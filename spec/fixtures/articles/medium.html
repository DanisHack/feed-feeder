Sex makes me feel realised and present in a way I never do alone. When I feel attractive and it’s summer and I walk around Dublin looking back into the eyes of the men watching me, I feel like a real living person momentarily. Life has taught me that being fuckable and young as a woman is to be real. Nothing else is guaranteed, but if you are those things, somebody will pay attention. Knowing that Lina was always watching me made me feel the same way. It was like adolescence all over again, being acutely aware of these odd corners of myself I hadn’t considered. I returned to my own Facebook pictures day after day like a dog to its vomit, pushing my mind into hers to imagine what she saw when she looked at them. I was fat in that one, it was true, but I looked beautiful in this one. I knew the beautiful ones hurt her, and it made me sad that I could not be more beautiful, to hurt her more.</p><p name="a6c2" id="a6c2" class="graf--p graf--last">Sometimes I miss her, now that it’s all over. I miss the feeling of being regarded, reported on, virtually examined. And I miss watching her, too, the nauseating but undeniably erotic thrill of seeing a new picture of her; sometimes I can still feel the low thrumming ache of her being allowed to exist out there in the world being more beautiful than me.</p></div></div></section><section name="dcb7"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="0215" id="0215" class="graf--p graf--first">I’m three episodes of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gossip Girl </em>and a bottle of wine deep into Friday night, squinting at Instagram. What I’m doing is rapidly flicking back and forth between a picture of my own face and a picture of my then-boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend’s face. I have spent a year obsessing over Lina, and it feels like I am on the brink of some insight at this moment, like I can finally place myself in a definitive rank relative to her. I’m trying to gauge the specific measurements of her face and how they weigh up against mine — the curl of her lips, the circumference of her plaintive Bambi eyes. Back and forth, over and over, I flick between the two of us and stare at her perfect face with such concentration that my phone should burst into flames like I’m in the crap Web 2.0 remake of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Carrie. </em>I’m on the verge of a breakthrough here, breathing quickly and feeling a deep yawning pain in my chest, and I’m not sure whether the breakthrough is calm acceptance or a disastrous and irreversible ego collapse. A thought comes to me then, clear as a bell, and the thought is “Her face is nicer than your face.”</p><p name="1820" id="1820" class="graf--p graf--last">I’ve never let myself consciously think this sentence before, but its truth has been at the crux of the pointless but complex experiment I have been conducting the last 12 months. It feels pleasurably harsh, feels the way it used to when I started smoking and loved the direct hit to the raw part of my throat, somehow both maddening and deeply satisfying. I settle down into my new thought, turning it over in my mind. Her face is nicer to look at than my face.</p></div></div></section><section name="1c62"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="8263" id="8263" class="graf--p graf--first">I was told about Lina obliquely, in hushed shadowy fragments, by my then-boyfriend David. They had separated after six years together, and she moved back to her home in the Middle East. They had a fraught relationship afterwards in which they sent vicious missives one moment and desperate avowals of love the next. The first I knew of her was when she added me on Facebook and immediately mailed me to say it was an accident and must have been because her fingers slipped. Slipped from WHAT I wondered, slipped from their previous activity of lightly fondling my profile pictures? I had only known her as a name from his past until then, but suddenly she was a flesh and blood, slightly unhinged woman. When she first discovered I was seeing him she had looked me up and began a long and extensive trawl through my social media accounts. She emailed him throughout each day to comment on her discoveries, and these he fed back to me. We would sit on my bed discussing. Lina had become obsessed by me, and he was obsessed by her because he was still in love with her.</p><p name="d8f2" id="d8f2" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“She said you looked fat in this picture,” he would say, scrolling down, “but sexy in this one.”</p><p name="17e1" id="17e1" class="graf--p">I grabbed the computer from him to take a closer look. Lina said I was childish, and not as pretty as her, but she also said she thought I was a good writer. Lina said I was overweight, and most likely not a good lover, because I was so young. Lina checked my Twitter account daily and emailed him to ask what the jokes meant because she didn’t understand the internet properly.</p><p name="0faa" id="0faa" class="graf--p">Each time a new observation of Lina’s was reported back to me, I would go back and look at the post in question, analysing an innocent photograph or link to slow meaningless death. I felt alive under her vivid, hateful gaze. I started to think of her when I did anything at all on the internet. When I wore a coquettish outfit and took a selfie, I thought “I hope you like this one.”</p><p name="dbb9" id="dbb9" class="graf--p">I wrote poems about him on my blog, which she would read and report back on; “When she says “the bird of your back,” does she mean your <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">tattoo </em>of a bird, or is it a metaphor?”</p><p name="805c" id="805c" class="graf--p graf--last">And so I wrote even prettier poems, exaggerating even further the depth of our relationship, just so she could see them, and know that he was mine. I pretended even harder to be a flippant Holly Golightly character who didn’t care what she thought, all the while gradually altering my entire online life to be a performance for her. I photographed our Valentine’s Dinners, our Sunday morning eggs, our beach walks with the dog, using her as the constant filter. Lina was the distant curator of the life I desperately wanted with him, one which never existed.</p></div></div></section><section name="ba7f"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="1c8a" id="1c8a" class="graf--p graf--first">One day when I was looking at Instagram I saw a mutual friend had posted a picture of Lina. She was serving a meal composed entirely of what appeared to be expensive foliage and she looked like the most wholesome and gorgeous person I had ever seen. The picture was so at odds with my impression of her as a vindictive and cruel person that immediately the situation toppled and I became obsessed with her. I looked at pictures of her several times a day. She was delicate and adored, she loved animals and small children, she went to gallery openings and had a cool job that didn’t involve photocopying. But most painfully, she was beautiful. She was beautiful like shy French girls in films who are about to come out of their shells are beautiful. She was beautiful in the way I’ve always resented because I am nothing like it; enormous, sad eyes; prominent bones which look in danger of shattering at the lightest touch; visibly full of barely pronounceable troubles which men long to fix. Girls like that have terrified me for my whole life. They are eccentric and whimsical, light as air, full of private mystery. They are Amelie, and I am Amelie’s perpetually drunk and unshowered housemate, always waking up Amelie from her quirky dreams by trying to order pizza at 5 a.m.</p><p name="503e" id="503e" class="graf--p">I could never mentally compete with Lina after that. I kept on going back between our pictures, trying to end up with a different result, but it never emerged. David and I moved in together, and I tried to forgive how beautiful they had been together, how beautiful I would never be.

Sex makes me feel realised and present in a way I never do alone. When I feel attractive and it’s summer and I walk around Dublin looking back into the eyes of the men watching me, I feel like a real living person momentarily. Life has taught me that being fuckable and young as a woman is to be real. Nothing else is guaranteed, but if you are those things, somebody will pay attention. Knowing that Lina was always watching me made me feel the same way. It was like adolescence all over again, being acutely aware of these odd corners of myself I hadn’t considered. I returned to my own Facebook pictures day after day like a dog to its vomit, pushing my mind into hers to imagine what she saw when she looked at them. I was fat in that one, it was true, but I looked beautiful in this one.

I have spent a year obsessing over Lina, and it feels like I am on the brink of some insight at this moment, like I can finally place myself in a definitive rank relative to her. I’m trying to gauge the specific measurements of her face and how they weigh up against mine — the curl of her lips, the circumference of her plaintive Bambi eyes. Back and forth, over and over, I flick between the two of us and stare at her perfect face with such concentration that my phone should burst into flames like I’m in the crap Web 2.0 remake of Carrie. I’m on the verge of a breakthrough here, breathing quickly and feeling a deep yawning pain in my chest, and I’m not sure whether the breakthrough is calm acceptance or a disastrous and irreversible ego collapse.

I settle down into my new thought, turning it over in my mind. Her face is nicer to look at than my face.","markups":[]},{"name":"8263","type":1,"text":"I was told about Lina obliquely, in hushed shadowy fragments, by my then-boyfriend David. They had separated after six years together, and she moved back to her home in the Middle East. They had a fraught relationship afterwards in which they sent vicious missives one moment and desperate avowals of love the next. The first I knew of her was when she added me on Facebook and immediately mailed me to say it was an accident and must have been because her fingers slipped. Slipped from WHAT I wondered, slipped from their previous activity of lightly fondling my profile pictures? I had only known her as a name from his past until then, but suddenly she was a flesh and blood, slightly unhinged woman. When she first discovered I was seeing him she had looked me up and began a long and extensive trawl through my social media accounts. She emailed him throughout each day to comment on her discoveries, and these he fed back to me. We would sit on my bed discussing. Lina had become obsessed by me, and he was obsessed by her because he was still in love with her.","markups":[]},{"name":"d8f2","type":1,"text":"“She said you looked fat in this picture,” he would say, scrolling down, “but sexy in this one.”","markups":[]},{"name":"17e1","type":1,"text":"I grabbed the computer from him to take a closer look. Lina said I was childish, and not as pretty as her, but she also said she thought I was a good writer. Lina said I was overweight, and most likely not a good lover, because I was so young. Lina checked my Twitter account daily and emailed him to ask what the jokes meant because she didn’t understand the internet properly.","markups":[]},{"name":"0faa","type":1,"text":"Each time a new observation of Lina’s was reported back to me, I would go back and look at the post in question, analysing an innocent photograph or link to slow meaningless death. I felt alive under her vivid, hateful gaze. I started to think of her when I did anything at all on the internet. When I wore a coquettish outfit and took a selfie, I thought “I hope you like this one.”","markups":[]},{"name":"dbb9","type":1,"text":"I wrote poems about him on my blog, which she would read and report back on; “When she says “the bird of your back,” does she mean your tattoo of a bird, or is it a metaphor?”","markups":[{"type":2,"start":136,"end":143}]},{"name":"805c","type":1,"text":"And so I wrote even prettier poems, exaggerating even further the depth of our relationship, just so she could see them, and know that he was mine. I pretended even harder to be a flippant Holly Golightly character who didn’t care what she thought, all the while gradually altering my entire online life to be a performance for her. I photographed our Valentine’s Dinners, our Sunday morning eggs, our beach walks with the dog, using her as the constant filter. Lina was the distant curator of the life I desperately wanted with him, one which never existed.","markups":[]},{"name":"1c8a","type":1,"text":"One day when I was looking at Instagram I saw a mutual friend had posted a picture of Lina. She was serving a meal composed entirely of what appeared to be expensive foliage and she looked like the most wholesome and gorgeous person I had ever seen. The picture was so at odds with my impression of her as a vindictive and cruel person that immediately the situation toppled and I became obsessed with her. I looked at pictures of her several times a day. She was delicate and adored, she loved animals and small children, she went to gallery openings and had a cool job that didn’t involve photocopying. But most painfully, she was beautiful. She was beautiful like shy French girls in films who are about to come out of their shells are beautiful. She was beautiful in the way I’ve always resented because I am nothing like it; enormous, sad eyes; prominent bones which look in danger of shattering at the lightest touch; visibly full of barely pronounceable troubles which men long to fix. Girls like that have terrified me for my whole life. They are eccentric and whimsical, light as air, full of private mystery. They are Amelie, and I am Amelie’s perpetually drunk and unshowered housemate, always waking up Amelie from her quirky dreams by trying to order pizza at 5 a.m.","markups":[]},{"name":"503e","type":1,"text":"I could never mentally compete with Lina after that. I kept on going back between our pictures, trying to end up with a different result, but it never emerged. David and I moved in together, and I tried to forgive how beautiful they had been together, how beautiful I would never be. I tried to be open to what love might feel like when I knew I was not the prettiest girl he had touched.","markups":[]},{"name":"3ff6","type":1,"text":"I wrote a poem about what it was like to live with him, about things you give up when you sew two lives together, and why the sacrifice was worth it. Trying to be romantic, I sent it to him in the post so he could read it in his hands and not from a screen.
