<p>There is nothing quite like attending college with your daughter. For all the difficulties of getting your children educated, nothing is more challenging than trying to educate yourself at the same time.</p>
<p>The journey started years ago, when our family was living in North Carolina. I was a stay-at-home mom with hopes of returning to school once Stephanie started kindergarten. Eventually, I wanted to become a teacher. My dream was that my daughters and I could go to school together during the academic year and have family time during the summer.</p>
<p>Then plans changed. Getting divorced and raising four daughters alone is not easy, but I decided to go back to school anyway.</p>
<p>It would be very slow-going&mdash;I was behind. Algebra wasn&rsquo;t even on my high school transcripts. So I found myself in community college, taking middle school math, three levels below the minimum college algebra class required to graduate. But I didn&rsquo;t give up. I enjoyed it. Going to school became my place to go to invest in myself while still having time for a young family.</p>
<p>At the same time I was taking those math classes, my oldest daughter Amy, an 8<sup>th</sup> grader, complained about the new teacher in her own math class. Her regular teacher had a medical issue, and Amy was having trouble understanding the substitute, an older man who told long, drawn-out stories that made no sense. So I suggested that we talk to him and see what we could do to help the situation. She agreed.</p>
<p>I had just come from my math class earlier that morning and felt I could handle this. We walked into the room and there was my college math professor sitting at the desk looking up and smiling at both of us. Amy looked mortified. &mdash; No! How could this be?</p>
<p>The two of us were taking the same class, which may have been embarrassing to Amy, but I thought it was great. I was happy to be with my girls and be in school.</p>
<p>He proved to be an amazing teacher. He set the two of us up in friendly competition. In the evenings, we would sit together and go over her homework. Amy looked at math as a puzzle and I turned his stories into a method that helped her see how to do the problems.</p>
<p>In her class, he would tell the students that Amy&rsquo;s mom had gotten an A on her homework&mdash;and wondered what Amy could do to beat her mom. He got the class interested in the game. She knew my grades before I did, and it made her feel special. He turned that around and did the same in my class, and students would ask him about my daughter. It was fun. More importantly, we both learned. As a side benefit, it brought us closer.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3692153"></div>
<p>We later moved to Arizona and Amy signed up for the high school marching band. Erin and Courtney&mdash;my other daughters&mdash;went to middle school and also signed up for band. Stephanie was in second grade. And I applied to Arizona State University.</p>
<p>Then reality hit.</p>
<p>Marching band for Amy included early morning practices at 6 a.m., Friday night football games and competitions every Saturday all across Arizona. Middle school involved field trips, teacher meetings and homework. Elementary school was filled with more field trips, class parties with baked goods and after-school activities. And I had a full-time job, I never signed up for classes at ASU after being accepted, and college went on the back burner.</p>
<p>The years flew by. One by one, daughters moved out, leaving Stephanie the last one at home. She started taking courses in high school that satisfied college credits. Since I was not working at the time, I decided to go back and finish what I started.</p>
<p>I went to my local community college to learn about my options. Stephanie came with me and together we looked at my transfer credits from North Carolina. Her face dropped when she saw my grades. The adviser and I looked at her and I asked what was wrong. Mockingly she said, &ldquo;Mom, really? One B? Out of all those A&rsquo;s? Why?&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t believe I had received good grades. Apparently my daughters thought I had made up my grades in college to &lsquo;inspire&rsquo; them to do well in their classes, since that&rsquo;s what moms do, you know! So I signed up and dug in.</p>
<p>Graduating with honors with an Associate&rsquo;s of Arts Degree, Stephanie sat in the audience&mdash;she was just four credits short of graduation.</p>
<p>In fall 2012, we both transferred to Arizona State. I chose to attend the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and Stephanie chose to be a photography major at the Herberger Institute. But when Stephanie visited Cronkite and saw pictures on the wall by photojournalism students, she decided to change majors.</p>
<p>As a mother, I tried to stay out of her way, planning my classes on a Monday-Wednesday schedule after finding her classes were on Tuesdays and Thursdays. She needed to have her own college experience.</p>
<p>But at the same time, there were moments when my daughter and I were peers. We laughed and cried during midterms and final exams. We rolled our eyes at difficult professors and homework assignments that made no sense. I also felt better connected to my other daughters and their educational experiences.</p>
<p>Stephanie took the fall semester off this year and spent time in Oregon and New York visiting two of her sisters. She plans to start at ASU again this January, and she should graduate next fall, having studied photography, journalism, and art history. Her goals are to get a master&rsquo;s in anthropology and to work for <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>
<p>Graduation should come this spring semester for me, as there is one core class I need in order to finish. Stephanie and I have become each other&rsquo;s biggest supporters and I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of all of our accomplishments. My daughter Courtney graduates this spring as well. Erin was the winner, having already graduated, but 2015 is our year!</p>

For all the difficulties of getting your children educated, nothing is more challenging than trying to educate yourself at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>The journey started years ago, when our family was living in North Carolina. I was a stay-at-home mom with hopes of returning to school once Stephanie started kindergarten. Eventually, I wanted to become a teacher. My dream was that my daughters and I could go to school together during the academic year and have family time during the summer.<\/p>\n<p>Then plans changed. Getting divorced and raising four daughters alone is not easy, but I decided to go back to school anyway.<\/p>\n<p>It would be very slow-going&mdash;I was behind. Algebra wasn&rsquo;t even on my high school transcripts. So I found myself in community college, taking middle school math, three levels below the minimum college algebra class required to graduate. But I didn&rsquo;t give up. I enjoyed it. Going to school became my place to go to invest in myself while still having time for a young family.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time I was taking those math classes, my oldest daughter Amy, an 8<sup>th<\/sup> grader, complained about the new teacher in her own math class. Her regular teacher had a medical issue, and Amy was having trouble understanding the substitute, an older man who told long, drawn-out stories that made no sense. So I suggested that we talk to him and see what we could do to help the situation. She agreed.<\/p>\n<p>I had just come from my math class earlier that morning and felt I could handle this. We walked into the room and there was my college math professor sitting at the desk looking up and smiling at both of us. Amy looked mortified. &mdash; No! How could this be?<\/p>\n<p>The two of us were taking the same class, which may have been embarrassing to Amy, but I thought it was great. I was happy to be with my girls and be in school.<\/p>\n<p>He proved to be an amazing teacher. He set the two of us up in friendly competition. In the evenings, we would sit together and go over her homework. Amy looked at math as a puzzle and I turned his stories into a method that helped her see how to do the problems.<\/p>\n<p>In her class, he would tell the students that Amy&rsquo;s mom had gotten an A on her homework&mdash;and wondered what Amy could do to beat her mom. He got the class interested in the game. She knew my grades before I did, and it made her feel special. He turned that around and did the same in my class, and students would ask him about my daughter. It was fun. More importantly, we both learned. As a side benefit, it brought us closer.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3692153\"><\/div>\n<p>We later moved to Arizona and Amy signed up for the high school marching band. Erin and Courtney&mdash;my other daughters&mdash;went to middle school and also signed up for band. Stephanie was in second grade. And I applied to Arizona State University.<\/p>\n<p>Then reality hit.<\/p>\n<p>Marching band for Amy included early morning practices at 6 a.m., Friday night football games and competitions every Saturday all across Arizona. Middle school involved field trips, teacher meetings and homework. Elementary school was filled with more field trips, class parties with baked goods and after-school activities. And I had a full-time job, I never signed up for classes at ASU after being accepted, and college went on the back burner.<\/p>\n<p>The years flew by. One by one, daughters moved out, leaving Stephanie the last one at home. She started taking courses in high school that satisfied college credits. Since I was not working at the time, I decided to go back and finish what I started.<\/p>\n<p>I went to my local community college to learn about my options. Stephanie came with me and together we looked at my transfer credits from North Carolina. Her face dropped when she saw my grades. The adviser and I looked at her and I asked what was wrong. Mockingly she said, &ldquo;Mom, really? One B? Out of all those A&rsquo;s? Why?&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t believe I had received good grades. Apparently my daughters thought I had made up my grades in college to &lsquo;inspire&rsquo; them to do well in their classes, since that&rsquo;s what moms do, you know! So I signed up and dug in.<\/p>\n<p>Graduating with honors with an Associate&rsquo;s of Arts Degree, Stephanie sat in the audience&mdash;she was just four credits short of graduation.<\/p>\n<p>In fall 2012, we both transferred to Arizona State. I chose to attend the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and Stephanie chose to be a photography major at the Herberger Institute. But when Stephanie visited Cronkite and saw pictures on the wall by photojournalism students, she decided to change majors.<\/p>\n<p>As a mother, I tried to stay out of her way, planning my classes on a Monday-Wednesday schedule after finding her classes were on Tuesdays and Thursdays. She needed to have her own college experience.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time, there were moments when my daughter and I were peers. We laughed and cried during midterms and final exams. We rolled our eyes at difficult professors and homework assignments that made no sense. I also felt better connected to my other daughters and their educational experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie took the fall semester off this year and spent time in Oregon and New York visiting two of her sisters. She plans to start at ASU again this January, and she should graduate next fall, having studied photography, journalism, and art history. Her goals are to get a master&rsquo;s in anthropology and to work for <em>National Geographic<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Graduation should come this spring semester for me, as there is one core class I need in order to finish. Stephanie and I have become each other&rsquo;s biggest supporters and I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of all of our accomplishments. My daughter Courtney graduates this spring as well. Erin was the winner, having already graduated, but 2015 is our year!<\/p>\n<p><em>Sandy Balazic is a single mom, a mini-doxie fan, an in-depth reporter for Cronkite News, an intern for NBC Sports Radio 1060AM and a soon-to-be graduate of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University.

The two groups say that 600 international units (IU) are generally enough for most healthy adults and that higher doses of vitamin D don&rsquo;t necessarily produce more health benefits. They also stress that those benefits are limited to bone health; there isn&rsquo;t enough evidence to support the idea that taking the vitamin can protect against heart disease, <a title=\"Vitamin D May Double Chances of Surviving Breast Cancer\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/16148\/vitamin-d-may-double-chances-of-surviving-breast-cancer\/\" target=\"_blank\">cancer<\/a>, diabetes or <a title=\"Low Vitamin D Increases Risk for Dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Study Says\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3089339\/study-research-vitamin-d-deficiency-dementia-alzheimers\/\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive decline<\/a>, all benefits suggested by some smaller studies.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;More isn&rsquo;t necessarily better,&rdquo; says Manson, who served on the IOM committee. &ldquo;In some cases, it can be worse.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Overdoing vitamin D can lead to calcium in the urine, which can cause kidney stones. Extremely high doses&mdash;around 10,000 IU a day&mdash;can trigger calcium deposits in the blood vessels, which can lead to clots that cause heart attacks. The IOM panel recommended no more than 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily to avoid these potential problems.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3761581\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a title=\"Want to Build Endurance?

Cut Back on Vitamin C and E Supplements<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When people are tested for vitamin D deficiency and come up short, some researchers caution against treatment. In addition to the dosage risks, there&rsquo;s also evidence that the lab tests for the type of vitamin D circulating in the blood, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, may not be the most reliable measure of a person&rsquo;s D levels. Plus, not all labs use the same standard test for picking up 25 hydroxy D, and they set different standards for what are considered normal levels. &ldquo;Clinicians are often left chasing a number, and trying to get patients&rsquo; blood levels up to a certain point,&rdquo; says Manson. &ldquo;But when you think about how many people are screened for vitamin D, and the concerns about the reliability in how it&rsquo;s measured, and the differences in what is considered normal ranges across laboratories, it&rsquo;s really concerning.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Better data may be coming soon, however. Several large trials are underway in which people are randomly assigned to take different levels of vitamin D supplements so researchers can study their health outcomes, from bone problems to heart disease, cancer, diabetes and more. Manson is overseeing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vitalstudy.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">the largest of these<\/a>, called VITAL, which has 26,000 participants. The results from these studies, which are being conducted in the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand, should be available in 2017. &#8220;We should have conclusive answers in about three years,&rdquo; Manson says.<\/p>\n<p>The studies will also look specifically at whether vitamin D levels and metabolism differ across racial and ethnic groups. Some studies have hinted that disparities by race in heart disease and certain cancer risks may be due to vitamin D, and the randomized trials will hopefully provide more information on whether that&rsquo;s true.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, Manson says doctors and patients should follow the IOM and USPSTF guidelines: doctors should not order vitamin D blood tests for all of their patients, and people shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 600 IU of the vitamin if they are otherwise healthy. The only people who may need regular testing for vitamin D deficiency, and possible supplementation, are those with malabsorption problems like Celiac disease, those who have had bypass surgery, or people who have already had fractures and have been diagnosed with osteoporosis. People taking certain medications, including treatment for tuberculosis, may also need to consider vitamin D pills.<\/p>\n<p>For everyone else, however, universal screening isn&rsquo;t necessary&mdash;and there isn&rsquo;t any reason to take more than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin D.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\"

This finding implicates perceived racial discrimination, a psychosocial factor, as a determinant of this leading cause of death among African Americans, alongside more commonly recognized behavioral factors (i.e. poor diet, lack of exercise).<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to deconstruct the sources for both systemic and interpersonal racism to pinpoint why these infractions still exist, and the steps that are necessary for change. We can kickstart that first step by implementing the second step: talking. Institutional and employment leaders must engage employees in conversations around inclusion, equality, and difference; this is a key step in the process of addressing mental health disorders among African Americans.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3761684\"><\/div>\n<p>Substantive dialogue is critical, but it&rsquo;s equally vital to note that simply starting these conversations is a powerful thing. It&rsquo;s a move that shows both internal and external stakeholders that your organization values the tenets of social justice and reflects an investment in community well-being. Beginning these conversations is also an explicit acknowledgement of the problem, which could help employees affected by racial discrimination build back trust in the institution.<\/p>\n<p>This critical dialogue also can&rsquo;t just be a one-time thing&mdash;it requires consistency and commitment. To be effective, these conversations have to be on-going, inclusive, and employ a technique called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/how-active-listening-makes-both-sides-of-a-conversation-feel-better-1421082684\">active listening<\/a>. Active listening communicates empathy and builds trust by using signs of attentiveness (i.e. paraphrasing, assumption checking, asking questions) to indicate unconditional acceptance and confirming the other&rsquo;s experience. This type of listening behavior will ensure that an employer&rsquo;s responses are not dismissive and authoritative. This form of listening reflects that the individual is respecting the other person&rsquo;s experiential reality, not just waiting to speak and give a predetermined statement.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important factors in these conversations is to acknowledge up front that racial discrimination does exist, and that the conversation leader and organization genuinely wants to create change that will promote better mental health for African American employees. Of course, conversations can&rsquo;t fix everything. They need to be complemented with stress reduction and communication workshops. Leaders and executives should also be aware of the signs of depression, anxiety, and stress in others and have a repository of mental health providers for referrals. This action may require additional training, but it is well worth it for the employees will see that they are viewed as fully-functioning humans, and not just producers.<\/p>\n<p>Taking these additional steps will create a culture that respects the voices, experiences, mental health, and holistic lives of African Americans. They present a visceral and impactful embodiment of the growing Black Lives Matter movement.<\/p>\n<p><em>Veronica Y.

The gun also recoils with greater force, requiring gunsmiths to print up sturdier plastic parts that can withstand the stresses of multiple rounds. After a period of trial and error, the team claims the CM901 can fire off several rounds &#8220;with little to no issues.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And the most unsettling part: the rifle can be printed using a $500 Da Vinci 3-D printer. That&#8217;s a bargain compared with the first 3-D printed firearm, which first rolled off of an $8,000 printer in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, hobbyists in the 3-D printed arms race, for better or worse, are getting more bang for their buck.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3206731\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module

The dozens of confirmed cases, described as an epidemic, are centered in Scott County, about a half-hour north of Louisville with a population of about 25,000.<\/p>\n<p>But the spike has been fueled by growing heroin and drug use in rural counties like this one. A number of Midwestern states have struggled with a recent uptick in drug and needle use, and Indiana specifically has seen an increase in the use of a powerful painkiller called Opana, which can be altered and injected. The number of deaths <a href=\"http:\/\/www.in.gov\/isdh\/files\/SER_Drug_Deaths_Indiana.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">related to opioids like Opana<\/a> rose from 200 a year in 2002 to 700 in 2012, according to the Indiana State Department of Health.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this area of the state, there&#8217;s relatively weak public health infrastructure to prevent the infection from spreading. Scott County is just one of five counties serviced by a single HIV testing clinic, and the county&rsquo;s relative isolation from a sufficient public health system can help explain the virus&#8217;s rapid growth, says Beth Meyerson, an Indiana University health professor and co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS\/STD Prevention.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3761476\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;The system isn&rsquo;t working and isn&rsquo;t strong enough from a public health perspective,&rdquo; Meyerson says.<\/p>\n<p>In a 2013 study by the non-partisan organization Trust for America&rsquo;s Health, Indiana <a href=\"http:\/\/healthyamericans.org\/assets\/files\/TFAH2013InvstgAmrcsHlth05%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ranked last in federal funding<\/a> per capita from the Centers for Disease Control.

In Indiana, $13.72 was spent on each Hoosier.<\/p>\n<p>Indiana has also seen an increase in Hepatitis C in many rural communities, says Meyerson, another warning sign that HIV may be spreading. According to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, about 25% of people who have HIV in the U.S. are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aids.gov\/hiv-aids-basics\/staying-healthy-with-hiv-aids\/potential-related-health-problems\/hepatitis\/\" target=\"_blank\">co-infected with Hepatitis C<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On Thursday, state authorities stepped in. Gov. Pence allowed local officials to start a 30-day needle-exchange program in Scott County as a way to stop the outbreak. &#8220;I do not enter this lightly,&#8221; Pence said, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.indystar.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2015\/03\/25\/gov-pence-visit-indiana-county-hiv-outbreak\/70427432\/\" target=\"_blank\">Indianapolis <em>Star<\/em><\/a>. &#8220;In response to a public health emergency, I&#8217;m prepared to make an exception to my long-standing opposition to needle exchange programs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3660564\/contraceptives-hiv-risk\/\" target=\"_blank\">This Contraceptive is Linked to a Higher Risk of HIV<\/a><\/p>\n<p>While dozens of cases have been reported, it&rsquo;s likely that there are many more still unconfirmed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect these counties will remain the center of the epidemic,&rdquo; Meyerson says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to be in other parts of southern Indiana, wherever our system is the weakest. We don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know right now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><span><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3503000\"

Even today, far too many party elites seem to think uncontested primaries are better. However, competitive primaries force an evolution of organizing models and new technologies that benefits campaigns and the public. The lack of a vibrant primary in 2016 would put Democrats at risk of falling behind Republicans in bringing technology to bear on campaign strategy &mdash; and that would be a big loss for both Democrats and the country.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3761397\/harry-reid-history\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Harry Reid&#8217;s Early Retirement Announcement Shows How Much He Likes to Plan Ahead<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3759729\/john-boehner-nancy-pelosi-mean-tweets\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Watch John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi Read Mean Tweets About Themselves<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/german-plane-crash\/germanwings-crash-dna-experts-match-families-dna-bodies-n331171?cid=par-time_20150327\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Jewelry, Clothing: DNA Experts Toil Over Victims' IDs <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/ou-says-sae-frat-members-learned-racist-song-national-event-n331416?cid=par-time_20150327\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">OU: Frat Members Learned Racist Song at National Event <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/german-plane-crash\/germanwings-crash-pilot-lubitz-homes-searched-investigators-n331131?cid=par-time_20150327\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Co-Pilot Tore Up Doctor's Note Before Doomed Flight <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Primaries are the research-and-development stages for the nation&rsquo;s political machines. It is during primaries that our politics evolve. This is true of policy as well as campaign strategy &mdash; especially online. Large organizations need deadlines to beta-test products. The Obama campaign in 2008 looked at the 50 state primaries as the best timeline to create new experiments, test them, and release finished products. Remember how well-oiled the Obama machine felt by the summer of 2008 when you couldn&rsquo;t turn a corner without some form of &#8220;Hope and Change&#8221; bombarding you in a battleground state?

Competing against Clinton &mdash; a household name, a former first lady, and a well-respected senator &mdash; as a first-termer with a name like Barack Obama was truly daunting. When you have an uphill battle, you are going to get creative, and that&rsquo;s what we did. As part of his early campaign team, we had to get a new and different set of voters to the polls. We needed to find younger voters who would be motivated by Obama&rsquo;s message. And for the first time in a presidential primary, that meant using social media and sending messages directly to voters&rsquo; cell phones.<\/p>\n<p>Back then, social media was seen as a fun new fad that kids were playing with &mdash; not as an organizing tool. Facebook had been open to non-college students for less than a year, and MySpace was in its prime. With each tool, we were able to target different voting blocks. We used Facebook mostly for reaching college-educated people, college students, and super-local groups. On MySpace we targeted young voters, military families (it was an easy way to communicate between military members overseas and family members back home), Silicon Valley techies, the entertainment industry, and women over 35.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3760030\"><\/div>\n<p>Over the course of the primaries, having multiple digital teams experimenting with new techniques pushed each campaign to become better and evolve more quickly. And, quite frankly, we enjoyed the challenge.<\/p>\n<p>In Iowa, we experimented to see if setting up a statewide MySpace page would return new volunteers. In Nevada, we built rapid-response interactive voice hotlines and text-messaging tools that reinvented the process for dealing with election violations. In South Carolina, we launched two-way text messages on canvasses to see how we could better tether canvassers to their local headquarters. On Super Tuesday, we created separate MySpace and Facebook groups to empower Obama supporters to self-organize, kept in touch with our hard-core base on Twitter, and used the social networking tool Eventful to send surrogates to rallies and build crowds quickly. In the late primaries, we tested new ways to engage young voters by combining offline advertising and point-of-purchase display advertising with text-messaging and toll-free hotlines that provided additional information.<\/p>\n<p>By the time the general election arrived, we were wielding more powerful tools with a known return on investment. We even built our own social media site (MyBO) for supporters and volunteers. All of that work during the primaries put the party in a stronger position for the general election. It also enabled Democratic firms and private-sector partners at social media sites to build more and more robust tools in the years that followed to allow candidates to engage with voters and vice versa. These advancements put Democrats at a serious advantage over the competition &mdash; and none of these advances would have been realized if not for a hotly contested primary.<\/p>\n<p>So what will we be missing if the Republicans have a debated primary and the Democrats don&rsquo;t? Their candidates and campaigns will get better at giving a rehearsed stump speech and answering questions at debates and fish fries. But the lost opportunities would go far beyond that.<\/p>\n<p>There is no question that Republicans are catching up when it comes to putting technology to work on the campaign trail &mdash; a competitive Democratic primary would allow us to stay out in front. We can pressure-test the new advances in ad-technology and mobile marketing by experimenting in each state primary with real deadlines and real results. Can hyper-geo-fencing different messages affect turnout on an election day? Can Democratic campaigns better divide their resources between direct-mail universes, walkable precincts and geo-fenced ads in gated-communities that can&#8217;t be canvassed? Can connected TV be integrated in a campaign&#8217;s field and in fundraising efforts?<\/p>\n<p>While the political results of a candidate who isn&#8217;t battle-tested are well known, the lasting effects from failing to evolve our political technology could not only put us at a disadvantage in 2016, but also put Democrats behind for years to come.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3760030\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Former%20Obama%20Tech%20Expert%3A%20Democrats%20Need%20a%20Competitive%20Primary%20%7C%20TIME&body=Former%20Obama%20Tech%20Expert%3A%20Democrats%20Need%20a%20Competitive%20Primary%0A%0ADemocrats%20risk%20falling%20behind%20Republicans%20on%20technology%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3760030%2Fformer-obama-tech-expert-democrats-need-a-competitive-primary%2F%3Fxid%3Demailshare\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3760030%2Fformer-obama-tech-expert-democrats-need-a-competitive-primary%2F%3Fxid%3Dfbshare\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1HWTazg&text=Former%20Obama%20tech%20expert%3A%20Democrats%20need%20a%20competitive%20primary%3A&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n\t<a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3760030%2Fformer-obama-tech-expert-democrats-need-a-competitive-primary%2F%3Fxid%3Dlinkedinshare&title=Former+Obama+Tech+Expert%3A+Democrats+Need+a+Competitive+Primary\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n\t<a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment livefyre-commentcount toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3760030\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3760030\/former-obama-tech-expert-democrats-need-a-competitive-primary\/\" data-title=\"Former Obama Tech Expert: Democrats Need a Competitive Primary\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.
