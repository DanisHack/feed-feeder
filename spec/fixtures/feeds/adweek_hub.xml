The San Francisco-based company, already facing pressure to grow its user base and value, didn&amp;#39;t gain users, though its revenue did meet analysts&amp;#39; expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to its earnings statement, total monthly active users remained at 320 million in the fourth quarter&amp;mdash;the &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/twitter-debuts-world-series-tv-campaign-champion-moments-167795" target="_blank"&gt;same number it had the previous quarter&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Total MAUs in the U.S. actually fell slightly, from 66 million to 65 million, while international users stayed at about 254 million.&amp;nbsp;Year-over-year user growth increased by 9 percent in the fourth quarter, and mobile users now make up 80 percent of all MAUs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After its quarterly earnings were released, the company posted this tweet:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; As of the end of January, we&amp;#39;ve seen MAUs return to Q3 levels. Confident in continued growth with disciplined execution. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TWTR?src=hash"&gt;#TWTR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; TwitterIR (@TwitterIR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/697533580117839872"&gt;February 10, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the quarter totaled $710 million, a 48 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2014. Advertising revenue was $641 million&amp;mdash;$410 million from the U.S.&amp;mdash;with 86 percent of that figure coming from mobile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;We made significant progress in scaling the total number of active advertisers to 130,000 in Q4, up almost [90 percent] year over year,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s remarkable we built this business in just five years from zero revenue. We saw a decline in monthly active usage in Q4, but we&amp;#39;ve already seen January monthly actives bounce back to Q3 levels. We&amp;#39;re confident that, with disciplined execution, this growth trend will continue over time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Earlier in the day,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/twitter-starts-using-algorithm-curate-users-timelines-169556"&gt;Twitter introduced a new algorithm&lt;/a&gt; that reorders tweets at the top of users&amp;#39; timelines based on their activity, interests and network.

The film begins with an introduction from Ron Howard, who says the made-for-TV feature was &amp;quot;thought to be lost in the Cybill Shepherd blouse fire of &amp;#39;89.&amp;quot; Clocking in at 50 minutes, it&amp;#39;s Funny Or Die&amp;#39;s second-longest video ever.

It was fun and it did well and so we&amp;#39;d always thought to ourselves: The next time we have that same kind of cultural touchstone moment, maybe we could do something interesting. We always kind of kept our eyes peeled for what was the right moment to do that again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We&amp;#39;ve done a ton of Trump-related content over the last couple months and it&amp;#39;s always done very well. This was an idea that Funny or Die editor in chief Owen Burke had in a meeting with Joe Randazzo (head writer of Comedy Central&amp;#39;s @Midnight), and Joe wrote the script during one of his hiatus weeks from the show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How did you get Johnny Depp to play Trump?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Johnny was the first person on board. It all came together quickly after that. He was on board immediately. He had come into the offices for a meeting with Adam McKay and Owen joined the meeting and let Johnny know, &amp;quot;Hey we&amp;#39;ve got this idea, we&amp;#39;ve got this script&amp;quot; and pitched it to him. He committed in the room. As soon as he was on board, we moved full steam ahead and the production and the rest of the cast came together very quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How long did this take to produce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We shot this in early December; we only had four days to shoot it. We shot it basically in and around the Funny or Die office&amp;mdash;there were a couple of other locations&amp;mdash;but primarily we shot here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When we shot it, we didn&amp;#39;t really know if Trump was the real deal. We knew that he was getting a lot of press, but we didn&amp;#39;t exactly know how long he was going to stick around. As the weeks went on and Trump kind of gained in popularity and became a bigger and bigger sensation on the political scene, we realized that we were going to have a little bit more time than we thought to put this together. We were able to get Kenny Loggins to come on board to do the theme song, and Ron Howard to do the intro. It all just kind of came together at the perfect time, where we were able to release this the day after the New Hampshire primary. This is a fun way for us to be a part of that story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The movie is based on Trump&amp;#39;s book, The Art of the Deal. How closely did you want to adhere to the source material versus adding in the current fervor about him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We make a lot of spoof film trailers. Essentially this is just a longer version of that. There are certainly some stories from the book that make their way into certain scenes in the film. But really, this was a comedic premise of this crazy, absurd person and having fun with that. It&amp;#39;s highly fictionalized. I mean, Alf is [Trump&amp;#39;s] best man at his wedding. But, he really did sue the NFL and he really did have to secure that property to build Trump Tower. All of those things really happened, but they didn&amp;#39;t happen exactly the way that we portrayed them, obviously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;At 50 minutes, this is one of your longer films. Are you going to be doing longer content like this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is something we want to do more of. We always had our eyes peeled for the right time and topic to do something like this. I very much hope we don&amp;#39;t wait as long to do the next one. The idea that Funny or Die is for short-form content and cable networks are for long-form content... I think that line has really blurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391132324/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391132324/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391132324/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391132324/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391132324/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391132324/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/AkHIl_G3h4A" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/funny-or-die">Funny or Die</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/johnny-depp">Johnny Depp</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/video">video</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/2016-presidential-election">2016 Presidential Election</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/television">Television</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/adam-mckay">Adam McKay</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 22:49:52 GMT</pubDate><author>Tim Baysinger</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169584 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/trump-depp-hed-a-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d8003fb/sc/38/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cqa0Ehow0Efunny0Eor0Edie0Egot0Ejohnny0Edepp0Eplay0Edonald0Etrump0E169584/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Ford Is Preparing for the Post-Car Ownership Era With Its New Mobile Service</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/VUyUdvbeTr0/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/ford-pass-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many millennials are eschewing car ownership, and Ford is offering a solution. Seeking to be both an auto and mobility company, Ford will launch a new mobile service in April to aid in transportation needs, regardless of whether you own one of its vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to Ford&amp;#39;s research, millennials are twice as likely as other age groups to opt for other methods of car access, such as car sharing or leasing. FordPass, a free smartphone app, helps users locate and pay for parking, pay for services via a mobile wallet called FordPay, get directions and vehicle assistance, and access exclusive merchandise and experiences like curbside pickup service at McDonald&amp;#39;s and 7-Eleven. Ford plans to expand the service to offer car sharing and on-demand shuttles in the future. The effort includes FordHubs, storefronts in New York, San Francisco, London and Shanghai that will offer directions, city guides and information on Ford technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To develop the platform, Ford studied best-in-class consumer experience brands for the past year and a half. The company took cues from TripAdvisor&amp;#39;s independent survey reviews; Amazon&amp;#39;s Mayday button, which offers instant tech support; Burberry&amp;#39;s digital runways; and Nespresso&amp;#39;s customer loyalty efforts, according to Elena Ford, vice president of global dealer and customer experience at Ford and the great-great-granddaughter of Henry Ford. &amp;quot;We figured out how their offerings could fit in with how our customers go through the retail experience,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; FordPass was developed with the next generation of drivers (Gen Z), who are currently 13 to 21 years old, in mind, said Sheryl Connelly, manager of global trends and futuring at Ford. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re fiercely independent and extremely impatient, and all of the things FordPass offers are about saving time: the shortcuts that will help you get from point A to point B.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Adds Ford, &amp;quot;Cars and trucks are still our core business, but now we&amp;#39;re focusing on building emerging transportation services. We want to be part of the sharing economy and the owning economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391119034/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391119034/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391119034/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391119034/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391119034/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391119034/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/VUyUdvbeTr0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding">Advertising &amp; Branding</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/ford">Ford</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:50:14 GMT</pubDate><author>Christine Birkner</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169575 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/ford-pass-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7fbb84/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Cadvertising0Ebranding0Cford0Epreparing0Epost0Ecar0Eownership0Eera0Efordpass0E169575/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Ad of the Day: Netflix Urges You to 'Binge for Love' in Romantic Valentine's Day Ad</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/bfT-PgJPCuI/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/netflix-binge-for-love-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; We&amp;#39;ve already seen the Netflix data that says young people use their favorite shows and movies as guide posts for compatibility when looking for a partner.

(This particular woman is into Orange Is the New Black, though, of which much less than 500 hours has been made&amp;mdash;so our hero might have to learn some of her other treasured Netflix titles, too.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The ad also references plot spoiling, a thorny issue that Netflix has &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-netflix-shows-you-consequences-being-worst-kind-rat-168188" target="_blank"&gt;used in its ads before&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;and is actually turning from a potential liability into something of a strength, or at least a running gag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CREDITS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Client: Netflix&lt;br /&gt; Director: Jonathan Entwistle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068428/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068428/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068428/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068428/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068428/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068428/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/bfT-PgJPCuI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/netflix">Netflix</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding">Advertising &amp; Branding</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding/creative">Creative</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/ad-day">Ad of The Day</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:27:21 GMT</pubDate><author>Tim Nudd</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169577 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/netflix-binge-for-love-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7fa747/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Cadvertising0Ebranding0Cad0Eday0Enetflix0Eurges0Eyou0Ebinge0Elove0Eromantic0Evalentines0Eday0Ead0E169577/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Ad Agency Execs Are Optimistic About Twitter's New Algorithm</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/GiPK133U-YY/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/twitter-algorithm-page-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Agency executives say &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/twitter-starts-using-algorithm-curate-users-timelines-169556" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&amp;#39;s introduction of a new algorithm for the top of the news feed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;could be the beginning of a series of bold moves for the platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The algorithm, officially introduced today, reorders tweets at the top of a user&amp;#39;s timeline with tweets determined by criteria such as account interactions, engagement and network activity. The feature is optional and is followed by the traditional reverse-chronological feed that for years has made the platform stand out from others. Execs, including some who received briefings ahead of time with details of what to expect, said the update could be just what the platform needs to win new users and generate more revenue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;This is a smart move for them to increase and surface better content and engagements and a better user experience,&amp;quot; said Noah Mallin, senior partner and head of social in North America for MEC. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ve walked a fine line in not alienating existing users while also not making this a clunky experience that would require something like toggling between multiple tabs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At the same time, Mallin added that Twitter has &amp;quot;really picked up the product pace,&amp;quot; which should translate into more opportunities for marketers to continue experimenting with the platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Chris Tuff, director of business development and partnerships at 22squared, said the algorithm very well might be the &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/twitter-needs-product-renaissance-get-out-its-current-funk-169189" target="_blank"&gt;renaissance&lt;/a&gt; many have been looking for from the company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Look at the history of Facebook&amp;mdash;it simply wasn&amp;#39;t sticky enough without their algorithm,&amp;quot; Tuff said. &amp;quot;Remember the backlash they saw? Twitter needs to focus on their differentiators&amp;mdash;and one of those is real-time&amp;mdash;but it&amp;#39;s too noisy for brands and users to break through the feed right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tom Hyde, social strategy director at Droga5, said Twitter&amp;#39;s challenge has always been &amp;quot;balancing signal to noise&amp;quot; for users. Even as it has released new features over the past year&amp;ndash;products such as tailored trends, Moments and &amp;quot;while you were away&amp;quot; tweets&amp;mdash;new features have felt cluttered and complex. However, Hyde said, if the algorithm surfaced more relevant content for users, it could significantly help them manage the hundreds or thousands of tweets that endlessly scroll by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;The introduction of an algorithm, front and center, might not be what the die-hard users want, but it&amp;#39;s what the platform needs,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The algorithm comes as Twitter works to grow its user base, which totaled about 320 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, according to its quarterly earnings released today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While many Twitter users took to the platform over the weekend to complain about the idea of an algorithm, Andy Amendola, director of digital strategy at The Community, said power users need to remember that Twitter has to take bold steps to grow its user base if it&amp;#39;s going to survive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;How can using data to better serve personalized content to users be a bad thing? And what took Twitter so long? If Twitter gets this right, it will be better for everyone involved&amp;mdash;but that&amp;#39;s a big &amp;#39;if,&amp;#39;&amp;quot; Amendola said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Moment Studio CEO Ken Kraemer&amp;nbsp;said Twitter&amp;#39;s time-based feed is central to what makes it Twitter. However, he added, the changes were bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;It is inevitable that Twitter will need to create some scarce, attention-rich inventory it can sell to advertisers if it is going to survive on an ad-rich model,&amp;quot; Kraemer said. &amp;quot;That means controlling the feed. Depending on how well they do it, it could destroy the timeline experience dedicated users love.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068427/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068427/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068427/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068427/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068427/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391068427/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/GiPK133U-YY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding/agency">Agency</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology/social">Social</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology">Technology</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/twitter">Twitter</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:24:00 GMT</pubDate><author>Marty Swant</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169571 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/twitter-algorithm-page-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7fa74c/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctechnology0Cad0Eagencies0Eare0Eoptimistic0Eabout0Etwitters0Enew0Ealgorithm0E169571/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The 10 Most Watched Ads on YouTube in January</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/jjdcyVUmOqQ/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/bernie-america-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz crashed Adweek and Google&amp;#39;s YouTube Ads Leaderboard in January, ranking the most-viewed ads on the video site, and a PAC&amp;#39;s anti-Donald Trump spot also made the top 10&amp;mdash;as Election 2016 began to heat up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sanders finished highest on the Leaderboard, with his well-received &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/bernie-sanders-stirring-new-campaign-ad-set-solely-tune-paul-simons-america-169120" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;America&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; spot finishing at No. 5.

The experiment was a success&amp;mdash;but for Adult Swim more than TBS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bee&amp;#39;s critically acclaimed debut was watched by 2.2 million viewers across TBS, TNT, Adult Swim, truTV and HLN, including 1.2 million in the 18-49 demo. However, the numbers were biggest not for TBS, which will be airing the show every Monday at 10:30 p.m., but for Adult Swim: 986,000 watched on Adult Swim, while 629,000 viewed it on TBS. The demo ratings also favored Adult Swim (570,000 viewers viewers ages 18-49, compared to 360,000 on TBS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While the multi-network premiere was intended to be a one-night only event, those Adult Swim ratings would suggest that Turner should continue to air the show there in some form. However, TBS tells Adweek the network has no plans to change its scheduling plans for Full Frontal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The show will air Mondays followed by two encores: Thursday night following Conan at midnight, and Saturdays at 11 p.m. after The Big Bang Theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Heralded as the only late-night show starring a woman (even though its 10:30 p.m. air time is outside of that daypart), Full Frontal with Samantha Bee currently has a 13-episode order, though sources close to the show anticipate that will be extended shortly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Turner&amp;#39;s five-network simulcast echoed Viacom&amp;#39;s strategy last September for the first episode of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/television/viacom-goes-big-trevor-noahs-daily-show-debut-which-will-air-all-its-networks-167153" target="_blank"&gt;which aired simultaneously across all of its major networks&lt;/a&gt;. That experiment drew 3.48 million viewers, 1.1 million of who watched on Comedy Central.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="367" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1H3mRe-7ra0" width="652"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391055938/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391055938/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391055938/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391055938/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391055938/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391055938/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/Yc5myKi83jw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/turner">Turner</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/full-frontal-samanthe-bee">Full Frontal with Samanthe Bee</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/adult-swim">Adult Swim</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/television">Television</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/tbs">Tbs</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/television/ratings">Ratings</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:49:25 GMT</pubDate><author>Jason Lynch</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169569 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/samantha-bee-adultswim-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7f243b/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Csamantha0Ebee0Es0Enew0Etbs0Eshow0Egot0Ehigher0Eratings0Eadult0Eswim0Ewont0Ekeep0Eairing0Ethere0E169569/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>YouTube Debuts First Original Content but Won't Say How Many Subscribed to Service</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/bTeU-1OQrpU/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/youtube-red-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; YouTube Red &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/television/what-you-need-know-about-youtubes-subscription-service-youtube-red-167695" target="_blank"&gt;launched last October&lt;/a&gt;, but the paid version of the popular video platform is getting its close-up today, debuting its first four original shows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As with any new subscription service in its early days, YouTube would not share specifics on subscriber numbers. Though, one of its most influential creators, Hank Green, ran an informal Twitter poll Monday to gauge how many people were actually paying $10 a month for ad-free content and YouTube&amp;#39;s music service&amp;mdash;and the numbers weren&amp;#39;t promising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; Are you a paying YouTube Red user?&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; Hank Green (@hankgreen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/696550189033652224"&gt;February 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt; Green followed up that tweet with one today showing how Red is affecting the bottom line of existing channels:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; If you would like to check to see how YouTube Red is affecting your channel earnings, I have created a spreadsheet: &lt;a href="https://t.co/eUuUUxQ4OZ"&gt;https://t.co/eUuUUxQ4OZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; Hank Green (@hankgreen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/697459614388912128"&gt;February 10, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike bigger subscription services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, YouTube isn&amp;#39;t banking on how many subscribers it can sign up. Instead, YouTube views Red as an additive service, more like a paywall for premium content. And, as of today, that content includes the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Scare PewDiePie&lt;/strong&gt;: This reality-adventure series from Skybound Entertainment (The Walking Dead) puts PewDiePie, the most popular YouTube creator, through terrifying experiences inspired by video games.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A Trip to Unicorn Island&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature-length movie follows Lilly Singh as she embarks on a 26-city global tour during which she has to remember to practice what she preaches: Happiness is the only thing worth fighting for.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Lazer Team&lt;/strong&gt;: From Rooster Teeth and Fullscreen Films, four small-town losers stumble upon an alien ship carrying mysterious cargo, leading to a battle to save Earth from an all-powerful enemy.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dance Camp&lt;/strong&gt;: This film from AwesomenessTV weaves an amazing story of unlikely friendships, unleashing passions and discovering yourself through the power of dance.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; YouTube is adamant it&amp;#39;s not trying to compete with Netflix, which is pumping $6 billion into its content offerings in 2016. But it is paying up for more original content from its other top creators including Jesse and Jeana of PrankvsPrank teaching celebrities how to pull off pranks; a reality-competition series from Albine Labs that puts YouTube creators in a zombie apocalypse; a 360-VR series that throws gamers into the high-stakes scenarios they play through every day; and CollegeHumor&amp;#39;s Bad Internet, which takes an absurdist look at Internet culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; YouTube also announced today it has ordered an additional two projects for Red, including a high-school comedy with Vine star Logan Paul, who was featured in an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/how-vines-hunky-goofball-logan-paul-plans-become-mainstream-superstar-169152" target="_blank"&gt;Adweek cover story on Jan. 24&lt;/a&gt;, and a feature-length, transgender-themed documentary with Gigi Gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391054894/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391054894/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391054894/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391054894/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391054894/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391054894/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/bTeU-1OQrpU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/netflix">Netflix</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/video">video</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/television">Television</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/svod">SVOD</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/youtube">Youtube</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/pewdiepie">PewDiePie</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/lilly-singh">Lilly Singh</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/youtube-red">YouTube Red</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:29:50 GMT</pubDate><author>Tim Baysinger</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169563 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/youtube-red-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7ef872/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cyoutube0Edebuts0Efirst0Eoriginal0Econtent0Ewont0Esay0Ehow0Emany0Esubscribed0Eservice0E169563/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Facebook Is Now Offering Automatic Captions for Brands Silently Playing Videos</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/aLEuRqa80qg/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/facebook-silent-video-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Closed captioning will now be brought to you by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Starting today, the Menlo Park-based company will begin offering two lines of automated captions in branded videos for free. The addition could be a new way for marketers to still use the silent autoplay feature while getting more messaging across. The update is meant as a way to give users more reason to watch videos rather than just scrolling by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to Facebook&amp;#39;s ad products marketing director, Graham Mudd, that means brands need to insert their message as quickly as possible before users move on. Internal tests conducted by Facebook found that captioned video ads increased video view time by 12 percent on average.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;In a feed-based environment, people are in control of what they consume,&amp;quot; Mudd told Adweek. &amp;quot;So, unless you focus on earning that attention, really through relevance, you&amp;#39;re not going to succeed as much as you would otherwise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; New results of an independent study conducted by Fors Marsh found that users recall content in a news feed even after seeing it for just a quarter of a second. A separate study for Facebook by Nielsen found recall increases to 47 percent after three seconds of viewing and to 74 percent after 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Facebook has seen massive growth of video on the platform. Last month on its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company revealed that users are now viewing more than &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/bolstered-holiday-budgets-facebook-s-ad-revenue-hit-56-billion-q4-169237"&gt;100 million hours of video every day&lt;/a&gt;. The volume of people who watch video every day is 500 million. (Since then, the company also &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/facebook-now-letting-everyone-iphone-livestream-video-169257"&gt;began letting all users use the livestream video feature&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Along with video, mobile is more important than ever&amp;mdash;mobile ad revenue now accounts for 80 percent of the company&amp;#39;s overall ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite the massive numbers related to video, Mudd said it&amp;#39;s still common for advertisers to simply repurpose video they ran on television. However, since mobile is a different experience, it requires different types of video. Mudd said the company has seen brands achieve much better business outcomes and attention rates when mobile video formats are taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;I think the massive adoption of smartphones, etc. is all coming together to produce a new advertising channel that has tremendous reach,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;And I think that mobile as a device is becoming one of the most&amp;mdash;if not the most&amp;mdash;important devices to people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Along with adding automated captions, Facebook also is expanding features that were previously only available in the U.S. In addition to offering new video ad analytics capabilities that independently measure ads, Facebook has made its &amp;quot;100% in-view&amp;quot; buying option available internationally. The option, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/100-in-view-impressions-and-moat-partnership"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt;, lets marketers only pay for video ads that pass all the way through a news feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391096756/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391096756/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391096756/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391096756/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391096756/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391096756/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/aLEuRqa80qg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/facebook">Facebook</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology/social">Social</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology/mobile">Mobile</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology">Technology</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/facebook-mobile-video">Facebook mobile video</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/facebook-mobile">Facebook mobile</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 17:29:24 GMT</pubDate><author>Marty Swant</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169565 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/facebook-silent-video-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7ec218/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctechnology0Cfacebook0Enow0Eoffering0Ecaptions0Esilent0Ebrand0Evideos0E169565/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>How Pizza Hut Ended Up in The People v.

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which covered Simpson&amp;#39;s efforts to flee authorities in pal Al Cowlings&amp;#39; Bronco, setting off what became the most-watched police chase in U.S. history. But another prominent brand was also on display in the show&amp;#39;s second episode: Pizza Hut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As 95 million people are glued to their TVs watching the daylong ordeal culminate in a two-hour police pursuit, the episode cuts to a scene in a Pizza Hut, which shows the restaurant has been so inundated with pizza orders that they have run out of their cheese supply and are unable to make any more pizzas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski&amp;#39;s script for that episode, called &amp;quot;The Run of His Life,&amp;quot; initially set the scene in a different pizza chain. &amp;quot;It was originally Domino&amp;#39;s, but we ended up getting permission to use Pizza Hut,&amp;quot; said Nina Jacobson, the show&amp;#39;s executive producer. &amp;quot;The idea was that the most popular pizza places ran out of cheese.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although Pizza Hut okayed its appearance in the miniseries, the company did not provide the production team with any 1994-era logos or material. &amp;quot;Our production designer put that together,&amp;quot; said Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Start of Brightcove Player --&gt;&lt;div style="display:none"&gt; Adweek responsive video player used on /video.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- By use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C found at https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/. --&gt;&lt;script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" src="http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;object class="BrightcoveExperience" id="myExperience4748616826001"&gt; &lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt; &lt;param name="width" value="652" /&gt; &lt;param name="height" value="367" /&gt; &lt;param name="playerID" value="3222576336001" /&gt; &lt;param name="playerKey" value="AQ~~,AAAAAEMe8RQ~,R8iUD_53FI8oumU8OTVt2hdMyPM6630E" /&gt; &lt;param name="isVid" value="true" /&gt; &lt;param name="isUI" value="true" /&gt; &lt;param name="dynamicStreaming" value="true" /&gt; &lt;param name="@videoPlayer" value="4748616826001" /&gt; &lt;/object&gt; &lt;!-- This script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon as the line is read by the browser.

O.J. Simpson. &amp;quot;It might be a little bit trashy, in this context,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pizza Hut didn&amp;#39;t pay for the promotion, but the chain should still benefit from its cameo in the critically acclaimed miniseries. Last week, The People v. O.J. Simpson&amp;mdash;which is &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/television/jeffrey-toobin-how-his-oj-simpson-book-became-one-seasons-best-tv-shows-169342" target="_blank"&gt;based on Jeffrey Toobin&amp;#39;s 1996 book The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;had the most-watched series premiere in FX history, with 12 million total viewers (6.1 million of them in the 18-49 demo) in live-plus-three ratings (including two encore broadcasts).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Ford Bronco, however, won&amp;#39;t be able to capitalize on its return to the spotlight. Ford discontinued the model in 1996, two years after Simpson&amp;#39;s police chase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; FX hasn&amp;#39;t shied away from featuring brands in its shows that aren&amp;#39;t paid integrations. Its new Zach Galifianakis comedy Baskets &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/television/why-fx-s-bizarre-new-clown-comedy-baskets-obsessed-costco-and-arby-s-169252" target="_blank"&gt;prominently features Costco and Arby&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt;, though that production received no money from either company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039419/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039419/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039419/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039419/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039419/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039419/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7e1b6b/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/6xJJWFxKTts" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/pizza-hut">Pizza Hut</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/television">Television</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/television/cable">Cable</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/fx">FX</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding/food-beverage">Food &amp; Beverage</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/people-v-oj-simpson">The People v O.J.

In other words, it&amp;#39;s close to being a done deal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;There is strong strategic and industrial logic to the acquisition of Opera by the consortium,&amp;quot; said Opera&amp;#39;s CEO Lars Boilesen in a statement. &amp;quot;We believe that the consortium, with its breadth of expertise and strong market position in emerging markets, will be a strong owner of Opera. The consortium&amp;#39;s ownership will strengthen Opera&amp;#39;s position to serve our users and partners with even greater innovation, and to accelerate our plans of expansion and growth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While Opera is often recognized for its Web browser software, the company has also built a strong mobile advertising business with its Opera Mediaworks arm over the past three years, particularly in mobile video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; During the fourth quarter of 2015, Opera reported $193.5 million in revenue, with mobile advertising accounting for $145.4 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In 2014, Opera acquired AdColony for $350 million and launched an in-house creative studio last year dubbed Opera House, which helps agencies build mobile video campaigns. Opera&amp;#39;s clients include &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/how-carls-jr-makes-most-6-second-mobile-video-ad-163099" target="_blank"&gt;Carl&amp;#39;s Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/stolis-mobile-ads-let-you-actually-feel-cocktail-being-made-your-hand-167812" target="_blank"&gt; Stoli.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Opera was one of the last, big independent mobile ad networks. After AOL acquired Millennnial Media last year &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/aol-scoops-mobile-ad-network-millennial-media-238-million-166698" target="_blank"&gt;for $238 million&lt;/a&gt;, industry experts speculated that &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/5-mobile-ad-players-may-be-acquisition-targets-165854" target="_blank"&gt;Opera may also&lt;/a&gt; be on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039418/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039418/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039418/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039418/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039418/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391039418/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/Cn2p6UKL0Kw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/mobile-video">mobile video</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/mobile-advertising">Mobile advertising</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology/mobile">Mobile</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology">Technology</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/opera-mediaworks">Opera Mediaworks</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/opera">Opera</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 16:00:29 GMT</pubDate><author>Lauren Johnson</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169561 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/mobile-groupm-data-hed-2015.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7e1b6e/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctechnology0Cmobile0Egiant0Eopera0Esoftware0Eclose0Eselling0Echinese0Eplayers0E120Ebillion0E169561/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Twitter Starts Using an Algorithm to Curate Users' Timelines</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/iuuxIYNo7QM/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/twitter-algorithm-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Twitter as we know it changes today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The San Francisco-based tech company has introduced an algorithm that will reorder the top of users&amp;#39; timelines with tweets it predicts will be interesting and relevant to them. Tweets that are selected are based on a number of criteria including account interactions, engagement, user interests and network activity. The rest of the newsfeed will then follow the traditional reverse-chronological order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The optional feature&amp;mdash;which will roll out gradually, and can be turned on or off by users&amp;mdash;is essentially an extension of the &amp;quot;While you were away&amp;quot; feature Twitter introduced in January 2015, Twitter vp of revenue products Ameet Ranadive told Adweek.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;The reason we&amp;#39;re doing this is there is just so much happening on Twitter every day, and we know it is sometimes easy for people to miss great content,&amp;quot; Ranadive said. &amp;quot;So, to solve this, we&amp;#39;re bringing the tweets from accounts that they follow that people are likely to care about the most, and we&amp;#39;re going to bring that to the top of the timeline.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ranadive said the new timeline will not affect any advertising products. Asked whether the update was the first step in making way for a pay-to-play algorithm approach like Facebook&amp;#39;s, he said, &amp;quot;Absolutely not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;All content on Twitter is created equal,&amp;quot; Ranadive said. &amp;quot;There is no barrier between a brand and their followers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Conversation around the idea heated up over the weekend following a Friday report from &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/twitter-to-introduce-algorithmic-timeline-as-soon-as-next-we#.uj1WKDpvl"&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that said Twitter was planning to introduce an algorithm model as early as this week. The platform exploded with upset users, resulting in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23riptwitter&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#RIPTwitter&lt;/a&gt; showing up as a trending hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next day, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey vaguely addressed the rumors with a series of his own tweets on the subject:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; Hello Twitter! Regarding &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIPTwitter?src=hash"&gt;#RIPTwitter&lt;/a&gt;: I want you all to know we&amp;#39;re always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; Jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/696081566032723968"&gt;February 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who &amp;amp; what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; Jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/696081671293001728"&gt;February 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; Look at &amp;quot;while you were away&amp;quot; at the top of your TL.

We get it.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; Jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/696083745435099137"&gt;February 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt; Thank you all for your passion and trust. We will continue to work to earn it, and we will continue to listen, and talk!&lt;/p&gt; &amp;mdash; Jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/696084334109859842"&gt;February 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Now that the changes are live, users and marketers will be able to see firsthand whether or not they like the option of having Twitter help pick which tweets they see. On Saturday morning, Bret Taylor, Facebook&amp;#39;s former chief technology officer, weighed in with his own tweet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Algorithmic feed was always the thing people said they didn&amp;#39;t want but demonstrated they did via every conceivable metric,&amp;quot; he wrote in the tweet. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Twitter, which tested the beta version of the new format with more than 100 users and brands, found that the update caused people to tweet or retweet more than they previously had. Brands in the beta test also saw increased organic reach, Ranadive said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s how we see this playing out. Brands will start to see that there is more organic engagement for their tweets, and we&amp;#39;re going to be directing them to some of these best practices so they can know how to continue to maximize their performance,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A blog post on Twitter&amp;#39;s website explaining the changes features testimonies from people and agencies that have tested the changes. Sarah Hofstetter, CEO of 360i, said the changes seem to be beneficial for both consumers and marketers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s clear Twitter has listened to its consumers and its partners, and we&amp;#39;re excited to get deeper under the hood to evaluate implications for our clients,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/2016_Feb/Twitter_timelines_update_7.gif" width="652" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391073478/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391073478/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391073478/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391073478/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391073478/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247391073478/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/iuuxIYNo7QM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology/social">Social</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology">Technology</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/twitter">Twitter</category><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 14:00:01 GMT</pubDate><author>Marty Swant</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169556 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/twitter-algorithm-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d7d7774/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctechnology0Ctwitter0Estarts0Eusing0Ealgorithm0Ecurate0Eusers0Etimelines0E169556/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>How Zoolander 2’s Kyle Mooney Got Addicted to an Old MTV Reality Show</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/YkauBJUIQPQ/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/kyle-mooney-01-2016.jpg"&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img alt="" src="/files/uploads/SPACER-652.gif" style="width: 10px; height: 1px; " /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Age &lt;/strong&gt;31&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Claim to fame &lt;/strong&gt;Saturday Night Live cast member; appears in the upcoming Zoolander 2 (in theaters Feb. 12)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Base &lt;/strong&gt;New York&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Instagram &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://instagram.com/kylemooney" target="_blank"&gt;@kylemooney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adweek: What&amp;#39;s the first information you consume in the morning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kyle Mooney: I check my email pretty immediately, and then usually Facebook or Twitter. And then whatever people are linking to, I&amp;#39;ll follow their lead. Sometimes for fun I&amp;#39;ll go to an animation blog called &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com" target="_blank"&gt;CartoonBrew.com.&lt;/a&gt; I also like to see what movies are screening in New York, so I use the website &lt;a href="http://www.screenslate.com" target="_blank"&gt;ScreenSlate.com.&lt;/a&gt; But honestly, I can&amp;#39;t really go to the movies because I&amp;#39;m usually so busy working, so it&amp;#39;s more of a wishful thinking thing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are your go-to social networks? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&amp;#39;ve definitely found myself having a lot more fun with Instagram in the past couple years. Something about it feels, I don&amp;#39;t know, slightly less formal. On Twitter, there is a pressure to be constantly saying something clever or witty, whereas on Instagram, I feel a lot more comfortable just posting a silly video or picture of myself. I also like Facebook because I can keep an eye on all these people that were once in the periphery of my life and draw inspiration from what they&amp;#39;re invested in or what pisses them off or makes them excited. I feel like Facebook statuses have become their own form of media, to some degree, and they&amp;#39;re something that I obsess over.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You actually created an Instagram account for Don Atari, your &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/zoolander-no-2s-ads-brilliantly-mix-fashion-world-even-while-critiquing-it-169035" target="_blank"&gt;Zoolander 2&lt;/a&gt; character. Tell me about that. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think everybody involved in the movie knew that I had somewhat of a social media presence and that I had done an Instagram video series, the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dandkpodcast/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;D and K Podcast,&lt;/a&gt; with my friend Dave over the summer. So Ben [Stiller] was into it and wanted to do something similar for Don Atari. It was more of a subversive promotion rather than just tweeting out links telling people to go see the movie.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Are there any YouTube creators you&amp;#39;re into? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I actually love found YouTube videos, like videos with 25 hits on them. I especially love kids who vlog and have these small audiences, but they&amp;#39;re constantly declaring to the camera, &amp;quot;Hey guys, sorry I haven&amp;#39;t made a video in a while!&amp;quot; as if the entire world is upset that they haven&amp;#39;t posted.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s your favorite app? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The one I downloaded most recently is one called &lt;a href="http://www.whosampled.com" target="_blank"&gt;WhoSampled.&lt;/a&gt; You can look up a hip-hop track or artist and it will give you the original sample source or the song that sampled it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What TV shows do you watch? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The show that I probably most consistently watched this past year was Little Women: LA. There are certain reality shows that have a gripping effect on me when I get into them. Like when I was shooting Zoolander in Rome, they&amp;#39;ve got Italian MTV, and I retroactively got really into this show called Friendzone because the premise is so insane. Basically, the show is about a guy or girl that has a best friend that they have a crush on and they go on a date, and they reveal that they&amp;#39;ve had these intense feelings. That moment, for me&amp;mdash;I cringe. I squirm in anticipation of whether the date will continue or not. I mean, I now seek Friendzone episodes on MTV.com.

Now located in downtown Jersey City, the office boasts sprawling views of Manhattan and the river, and it serves as the hub for the &lt;a href="http://www.forbesmedia.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Forbes Media&lt;/a&gt; state-of-the-art newsroom. The space also provided a blank slate for &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/mike-perlis-named-president-and-ceo-at-forbes-media/21844" target="_blank"&gt;Forbes CEO Mike Perlis&lt;/a&gt; to reimagine his new digs. His ninth-floor perch is outfitted with mementos and items collected over this 30-plus years in the media world, which has included stints at Playboy, Ziff Davis and even a spell in the VC world at SoftBank Capital. As it turns out, the move out of New York hasn&amp;#39;t been that difficult. &amp;quot;Jersey City is just a little bit farther,&amp;quot; said Perlis, &amp;quot;but people love being here in this carefully thought-out, clearly digital space.

&lt;p&gt; Jeep&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Portraits&amp;quot; ad, which aired at halftime of Super Bowl 50 and ended up being our &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news-gallery/advertising-branding/5-best-ads-super-bowl-50-169503" target="_blank"&gt;favorite spot of the game,&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;#39;t just riveting in its content. It was radical in its format. On a night when &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/television/1119-million-viewers-super-bowl-50-was-no-3-most-watched-all-time-169507" target="_blank"&gt;111.9 million viewers&lt;/a&gt; were watching the telecast on horizontal screens, &amp;quot;Portraits&amp;quot; was a vertical video&amp;mdash;using less than half of the available screen space.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sean Reynolds, global executive creative director at iris, whose New York office created the 60-second spot, told Adweek that the content just called for that approach&amp;mdash;and it happened to look great on mobile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;The close crop was important to really focus the viewer on the eyes and the stories they tell,&amp;quot; Reynolds said. &amp;quot;We always had the idea that because it&amp;#39;s a portrait ad, it would look great on a mobile device. So we spent a lot of time talking and testing with YouTube to make sure it played full-screen on a portrait device.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/2016_Feb/jeep-vertical.jpg" style="width:250px;float:left;padding:5px 15px 5px 0;" /&gt;Indeed, it does. If you cue up the YouTube version on a smartphone and maximize to fill the screen, it plays beautifully in the vertical format&amp;mdash;likewise on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The standard horizontal aspect ratio these days is 16-by-9. This video is approximately 7.7-by-9 (it takes up about 48 percent of the horizontal screen). &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not a standard aspect ratio,&amp;quot; Reynolds said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s one that we came up with based on the best crop of images we were using and the fact that it had to look great on a mobile device.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The approach was unusual, but that was part of the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;We had a great client that shared in our desire to be brave and do something a little unexpected with the ad,&amp;quot; Reynolds said. &amp;quot;For us it was never about whether we used the whole screen or not, it was about creating the most impactful piece that we could.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thanks to subtle visual touches throughout the spot, the photos are never entirely static. The camera zooms almost imperceptible in and out, and there are even a few cinemagraphs&amp;mdash;static photos enhanced with a small portion that is moving. These touches add texture, says Reynolds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;There is a slight camera move on every image. It just really helped with the visual storytelling, and although subtle, I believe it helped with the craft of the final edit,&amp;quot; he said. The cinemagraphs, he added, were &amp;quot;something we always intended to do. The trick was not to overdo it, so as not to detract from the images themselves, but to add some additional texture. They also act as little visual &amp;#39;Easter eggs&amp;#39; that make people want to go back and watch it again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Asked which of the &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/what-famous-faces-jeeps-super-bowl-ad-really-had-do-vehicle-169489" target="_blank"&gt;stunning photos&lt;/a&gt; are personal favorites, Reynolds said there are too many to count.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;I think they all help tell the unbelievable, authentic story of Jeep over its course of 75 years,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The fact that they are all different, imperfect and not overstylized, was very important. Obviously the focus is on the power and beauty of people&amp;#39;s eyes and the stories behind them. I also love the visual play of the story and images&amp;mdash;the girl peeking through her fingers when we say fear. The dog and rear of the Jeep when we say wandered and roamed. And I personally have a soft spot for the smiley face on the Jeep headlight.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="367" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKn5K5V7tRo?rel=0" width="652"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The poetic voiceover copy also makes the spot evocative. &amp;quot;The original write was almost 90 seconds, so there were several versions we went through when shortening it down to 60,&amp;quot; said Reynolds. &amp;quot;The important thing was to always demonstrate and maintain the breadth of Jeep stories, no matter the iteration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The craft is impressive indeed, in its simplicity and quiet daring. But Reynolds says the true power of the piece resides in the authenticity of its subjects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;The most compelling and beautiful thing we found was the sheer emotion and power behind people&amp;#39;s real Jeep stories,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;When we spoke to George Speaker&amp;#39;s daughter Alice about her dad, and the pride that they had in him and his Jeep portrait, it brought a tear to all of our eyes.

Viacom has also launched two new global Discover channels on Snapchat: MTV and Comedy Central. Before today, MTV&amp;#39;s Discover hub was only available internationally and Comedy Central&amp;#39;s was only available to U.S. users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In addition to selling ads within Discover, Viacom&amp;#39;s sales teams will pitch the app&amp;#39;s Live Story promos to brands. Live Stories are curated strings of photos and videos collected at events like &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/7-brands-already-running-super-bowl-campaigns-snapchat-169481" target="_blank"&gt;the Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and awards shows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &amp;quot;multiyear&amp;quot; deal underscores&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/heres-how-snapchat-became-such-hot-platform-digital-marketers-so-little-time-169027" target="_blank"&gt;Snapchat&amp;#39;s rise as a video platform&lt;/a&gt; with scale comparable to that of TV, at least in terms of reaching millennials and centennials. It&amp;#39;s also the latest step in Viacom&amp;#39;s aggressive &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/mtv-making-periscopes-taco-bell-during-weekends-vmas-166585" target="_blank"&gt;push into digital&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and ongoing effort to&amp;nbsp;stay relevant as cord cutting becomes more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Adweek spoke with Jeff Lucas, head of sales at Viacom, about the partnership and how it affects marketers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adweek: What was the rationale behind the Snapchat partnership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jeff Lucas:&amp;nbsp;If you take a look at the two companies and what we do, we go well together in terms of audience and content. We&amp;#39;re the largest broadcaster to the millennial and centennial generation, and Snapchat is, on mobile, the No. 1 broadcaster to the millennial generation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When you put that platform and content with it, it&amp;#39;s great for storytelling, targeting [and] measurement.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t the first time that you&amp;#39;ve worked with Snapchat though, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No, we started working with Snapchat very early on and saw [how] their value popped with our audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They value our expertise in content creation and marketing, and we value their expertise in reaching a very hard-to-reach audience.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In addition to selling the ads, is Viacom involved with the creative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think that the process needs to be worked out. We&amp;#39;re already in business with Snapchat, so we have a process for clearing all creative with them. And that will continue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So, Snapchat is still heavily involved then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We have a large sales force; Snapchat has their own sales force. We&amp;#39;re working together, and we&amp;#39;ll coordinate. But just remember&amp;mdash;they have their own sales force, their whole process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently, we have a system in place with the amount of Snapchat [inventory] that we sell, but as we increase that amount, we&amp;#39;ll have to develop additional systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We want to deliver more value for our audience. I think part of doing that is getting Comedy Central and MTV on the platform&amp;mdash;the two leading millennial brands.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In addition to Discover, part of the deal also includes selling Live Stories. What&amp;#39;s included in that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We sell the inventory on our two Discovery channels and then add onto that. We have our tent-pole events, which will be featured in Live Stories that we can sell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There will be certain times when we also work with Snapchat owned-and-operated inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390947855/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d79545b/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390947855/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d79545b/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390947855/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d79545b/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390947855/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d79545b/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390947855/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d79545b/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390947855/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d79545b/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d79545b/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/eRloXzjKtO4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology/mobile">Mobile</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/technology">Technology</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/mtv">MTV</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/snapchat">Snapchat</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/viacom">Viacom</category><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 22:09:29 GMT</pubDate><author>Lauren Johnson</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169550 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/2016_Feb/mtv-snapchat-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d79545b/sc/28/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Ctechnology0Cqa0Eviacom0Ebetting0Esnapchat0Estay0Erelevant0Emillennials0E169550A/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Ad of the Day: Tesco Plays Matchmaker for Valentine's Day With 'Basket Dating'</title><link>http://feeds.adweek.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~3/Ln9aH38eb2E/story01.htm</link><description>&lt;img src="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/basket-dating-hed-2016.png"&gt; &lt;p&gt; Are you judging potential Valentines based on their &amp;hellip; baskets? If so, British supermarket chain Tesco has the perfect campaign for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; BBH Live put out a call for a range of single folks&amp;mdash;not actors&amp;mdash;and asked what they&amp;#39;d put in their shopping baskets for a Friday night at home if they had &amp;pound;20 (about $30) to spend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thirty-two people initially participated, divided into four groups for the purposes of the social experiment: younger, older, gay men and gay women. Based solely on the contents of their baskets, psychotherapist Rachel Morris paired 16 couples&amp;mdash;four within each group&amp;mdash;for potential dates. (Hey, it beats picking partners based on equal measures of desperation, alcohol and swiping right, which is how these things are done most of the time.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Meetups in the entertaining clip, which is approaching 10 million Facebook views in less than a week, were shot in Tesco&amp;#39;s Hemel Hempstead store&amp;mdash;with no pre-meets, scripting or retakes. So the participants&amp;#39; reactions in the aisles, we&amp;#39;re told, are 100 percent authentic, as are their interactions in the dinner date scenes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="367" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-TV5e_9Pfe4" width="652"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;It was all based around two insights,&amp;quot; BBH&amp;#39;s Kate Murphy tells Adweek. &amp;quot;One: that what&amp;#39;s in your shopping basket says a lot about you as a person. And two: that you are more likely to find love in a supermarket than a nightclub. We then just worked out a process of how we could test that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the agency sent four couples on dates. Murphy says two got on well, while two others did not. That&amp;#39;s a pretty respectable matchmaking percentage. One couple actually plans to meet in Nepal in a few weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What&amp;#39;s the big takeaway for viewers? According to Murphy, &amp;quot;We want them to feel that Tesco has been brave and gone against the grain by talking about singles, rather than pushing out the same old couples messaging.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That seems totally on brand. Dating can be scary sometimes, and &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/tesco-ambushes-poor-shoppers-tricked-out-spookermarket-halloween-167778" target="_blank"&gt;so can shopping at Tesco.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;CREDITS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Client: Tesco&lt;br /&gt; Agency: BBH Live&lt;br /&gt; BBH Live Creative: Kate Murphy&lt;br /&gt; BBH Live Creative Director: Mara Vidal&lt;br /&gt; BBH Deputy Executive Creative Director: Caroline Pay&lt;br /&gt; BBH Live Strategist: Becky Dailey&lt;br /&gt; BBH Live Account Director: Valdemar Domingos&lt;br /&gt; Head of BBH Live: Ben Shaw&lt;br /&gt; BBH Producer: Laura Graham&lt;br /&gt; BBH Assistant Producer: Mary Lou Newnham&lt;br /&gt; Production Company: Black Sheep Studios&lt;br /&gt; Director: David Stoddart @ Dark Energy Films&lt;br /&gt; Executive Producer: Anthony Austin&lt;br /&gt; Producer: Phil Barnes&lt;br /&gt; DoP: Denis Madden&lt;br /&gt; Post Production: Unit&lt;br /&gt; Editor/Editing House: Black Sheep Studios&lt;br /&gt; Sound: Unit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390989094/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390989094/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390989094/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390989094/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390989094/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/247390989094/u/49/f/641570/c/34792/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/adweek/all-news/~4/Ln9aH38eb2E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding/agency">Agency</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding">Advertising &amp; Branding</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/uk-0">U.K.</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/advertising-branding/creative">Creative</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/tesco">Tesco</category><category domain="http://www.adweek.com/topic/bbh">Bbh</category><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 21:08:21 GMT</pubDate><author>David Gianatasio</author><guid isPermaLink="false">169551 at http://www.adweek.com</guid><media:content lang="" type="image/png" url="http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/news_article/basket-dating-hed-2016.png" /><feedburner:origLink>http://adweek.feedsportal.com/c/34792/f/641570/s/4d792e6f/sc/13/l/0L0Sadweek0N0Cnews0Cadvertising0Ebranding0Cad0Eday0Etesco0Eplays0Ematchmaker0Evalentines0Eday0Ebasket0Edating0E169551/story01.htm</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
