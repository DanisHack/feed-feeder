Although I like to think of ANIMAL as multifaceted, we often got pegged as a street art site. That was fine by me, since I always thought the scene <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/dont-be-fooled-by-this-fake-street-art-its-actually-guerrilla-advertising-for-a-tv-show/">needed a</a> <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/nyc-real-estate-worlds-gentrification-urban-art-collide/">critical voice</a>. Despite its surging popularity, the current state of street art is just getting boring, &#8212; and, seriously, waaaay too white. </p>
<p>But here are some of my fondest memories: <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2009/diane-sawyers-ground-zero-tenaciousness/">touring Ground Zero with journalist Diane Sawyer</a> on the night of September 11th, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/cost-is-up/">profiling</a> NYC street art/graffiti king COST (as well as <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2014/trap-true-art-graffiti/">TRAP</a>, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2014/plasma-slugs-graffiti-like-colony-art/">Plasma Slugs</a>, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/haeler-graffiti-keeps-detroit-from-looking-like-a-ghost-town/">HAELER</a>, and <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/the-sun-speaks-sabio-discusses-graffiti-pixacao-and-his-new-exhibit/">SABIO</a>), <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/tag/holiday-in-cairo/">covering</a> the unrest in Egypt, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2012/weak-men-pay-this-boxing-coach-to-tell-them-they-are-terrible/">showing</a> boxing coach Eric Kelly torturing Wall Street Types, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2012/russian-dashcam/">explaining</a> why so many Russians have so many dashcams, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/?s=rap+quotes">putting</a> up the &#8220;Rap Quotes,&#8221; interviewing the &#8220;<a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2009/meet-the-hipster-grifter-animal-spends-the-night-with-kari-ferrell/">Hipster Grifter</a>,&#8221; <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/we-made-an-anthem-for-rent-is-too-damn-high-candidate-jimmy-mcmillan/">making</a> Jimmy McMillan a campaign anthem, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/citi-bike-bmx/">asking</a> a BMX champ to ride a Citi Bike, <a href="http://banksy.animalnewyork.com/">following</a> Banksy around for like a month (and <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/the-untold-story-of-banksys-first-new-york-show/"> publishing an account</a> of his first show ever in the city), <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/theres-a-massive-illicit-bust-of-edward-snowden-stuck-to-a-war-monument-in-brooklyn/">documenting</a> the installation of the Edward Snowden bust in Brooklyn, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/porn-star-carter-cruise-learns-how-to-tag-with-graffiti-artist-sabe/">shooting</a> SABE teaching porn star Carter Cruise how to do graffiti, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/fear-black-santa/">searching</a> for Black Santa, and always, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/the-apology-the-new-york-post-should-have-issued/">pranking</a> those megalomaniacal warmongers at the <em>New York Post</em>. </p>
<p>I also managed to <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2015/adventures-trespassing-owned-190-bowery-three-days/">infiltrate the mysterious 190 Bowery</a>, breach a police line <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2011/occupy-wall-street-getting-raided-by-nypd/">during the raid on Occupy Wall Street</a>, where I documented the destruction of the People’s Library, evidence that was later used in part by super lawyer Norman Siegel to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/occupy-wall-street-settles-lawsuit-city-books-destruction-232k-article-1.1312565">win a settlement against the city</a>. Or there was that time those cops threw out their anti-terrorism manuals into city trash cans right outside their stationhouse? The NYPD’s spokesperson called me a &#8220;<a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/13/blogger-says-he-found-sensitive-nypd-terror-document-in-trash-can/">dumpster-diver</a>&#8221; when <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2011/the-nypd-needs-to-do-a-better-job-of-destroying-their-terrorism-prevention-plans/">I published it</a>. I&#8217;d still rather be called that than &#8220;NYPD spokesperson.&#8221; #ACAB for life. </p>
<p>Here are the main misfits who helped me make ANIMAL better over the past few years and tolerated me being a stubborn goon longer than they needed to: </p>
<p><strong>Marina Galperina</strong>, who now runs the best site ever <a href="http://www.hopesandfears.com/">www.hopesandfears</a>. </p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s <strong><a href="http://www.aymann.com/#0">Aymann Ismail</a></strong>, one of <a href="http://www.aymann.com/#0">the most fearless photographers</a> and best video editors in the game. He&#8217;s the guy you know will never run away from anything, even if it&#8217;s <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2014/sky-high-rush-climbing-williamsburg-bridge/">like 1,000 feet in the air</a> or <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/this-is-what-it-looks-like-just-before-the-muslim-brotherhood-jumps-you/">he&#8217;s about to get beatdown by Arab extremists</a>. </p>
<p>Poached by Gawker a little over a year ago, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/cushac">Andy Cush</a></strong> did <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/author/andy/">great work</a> and was ANIMAL&#8217;s third longest survivor. Not only was he a good journalist, but also a great sound engineer, who could <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2012/pug-destroyer-dogs-singing-death-metal/">mix puggles squealing over death metal</a> and make <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2014/rob-ford-dancehall-remix/">Rob Ford bounce in a dancehall reeeemix</a>. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t forget our graphics guru <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/natecepis">Nate Cepis</a></strong>, and founding <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/tag/todays-pigeon/">pigeon editors</a>, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/abagg?lang=en">Allison Bagg</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.michaelimmerman.com/">Michael Immerman</a></strong>, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/tag/what-do-you-think-your-dog-is-thinking/">both of whom</a> were <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/tag/animals-eating-animals/">great at making videos</a> as well. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll always be grateful to <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/author/kari-ferrell/">the</a> <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/author/michael-rougeau/">exceptional</a> <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/author/rhett-jones/">cast</a> <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/author/american-in-training/">of contributors</a>. Shout out to <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/tag/backdoor-pharmacist/">the <strong>Backdoor Pharmacist</strong></a>! And <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/show/ill-doctrine/">Jay Smooth</a>. </p>
<p>Lost in the shuffle of ANIMAL history is artist and tennis fanatic <strong>Matt &#8220;<a href="https://instagram.com/dsense1/">DSENSE</a>&#8221; Trumino</strong>, who I founded the magazine with in 2003 as a print publication <a href="http://pagesix.com/2004/12/12/page-six-18/">that threw enormous parties</a>.</p>
<p>Also, big respects to our original bail bondsman, <a href="https://twitter.com/tccwebster"><strong>Tom Webster</strong></a> and of course, blog sherpa <strong><a href="http://ratter.com/">AJ Daulerio</a></strong>.  </p>
<p>Take a look at some of our tops posts from the past few years (<a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2014/animals-top-40-features-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2013/best-animal-2013/">2013</a>, <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2012/the-best-of-animal-2012/">2012</a>). We were always at our best when we were a small team. I guess I just always like it that way. </p>
<p>And the record spins on&#8230; </p>

This week, we profile <a href="http://instagram.com/jcorptm">JCORP</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Name/Alias:</strong><br />
JCORP / JC♥RP / J</p>
<p><strong>Decade you were born in:</strong><br />
Early 1990s (when Sailor Moon first came out!).</p>
<p><strong>City you currently live:</strong><br />
Brooklyn, NY.</p>
<p><strong>Drugs or natural highs? </strong><br />
Both!</p>
<p><strong>How did you get your name?</strong><br />
‘J’ is me, obviously. As for ‘CORP’, I thought that the idea of an artist-as-corporation was seriously funny, like in an oxymoronic kind of way, so I put the two and two together. Plus, corporations are badass as shit. It’s like Dr. Evil’s Virtucon, Futurama’s MOMcorp, or Portal’s Aperture Science Labs. How sick would it be for a single, girl artist to pull off some legit, corporation-level stunt?  It’s kind of evil. That’s what I was going for when I made JCorp. I never meant for it to be my name as much as my omnifarious fantasy brand name.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://i2.wp.com/content.animalnewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/sts-july13-jcorp-1.jpg?resize=896%2C448" alt="sts-july13-jcorp-1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-345606" data-recalc-dims="1" /></center></p>
<p><strong>Why do what you do?</strong><br />
After a while, J(Corp) kind of just became her own real-life fictional character. It was awesome, so I ran with it. I do a lot more as JCORP than street art alone &#8211; I write, direct, and perform the narrative that forms her character. So essentially, I think J is just an excuse for me to be in badass-magical-boss-bitch mode. As for J, she really does what she does for love, justice, and gold. ✌</p>
<p><strong>How does your mother feel about your art?</strong><br />
My mother is the baddest of them all. At my age she was pulling off some serious international espionage grade schemes (no joke) and she was a brilliant artist &#8211; so I guess she enjoys watching me follow in her footsteps? Thanks for the bomb genes, Mom! ♥</p>
<p><strong>Are you making a living off your art? How&#8217;s that working out so far?</strong><br />
Like I said &#8211; love, justice, and gold. I get plenty of the first two (shout out to all my cool friends!) but I could always use more $ too… ☞http://jcorptm.storenvy.com/☜, you guys!</p>
<p><strong>Fuck the art world or embrace the art world?</strong><br />
Art world or anywhere else, I embrace the friends and fuck the haters.</p>
<p><strong>Do you bring your smart phone into the bathroom with you? Why?</strong><br />
All the time! That’s when I catch up with my freemium game addiction (lately it’s LINE PLAY, it used to be Tiny Towers, and Pixel People before that&#8230;)</p>
<p><center><img src="http://i0.wp.com/content.animalnewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/sts-july13-jcorp-2.jpg?resize=896%2C448" alt="sts-july13-jcorp-2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-345607" data-recalc-dims="1" /></center></p>
<p><strong>Do you ever feel like giving up?</strong><br />
Yes, but Usagi can’t give up being Sailor Moon, so&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Suggest an artist to follow.</strong><br />
Badass girls! <a href="https://instagram.com/miishab/">Miishab</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/imamaker/">ImAMaker</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/hissxx/">Hiss</a>.

<p>Nash is another perfect example of an innovator making a quality product from scratch. In the third episode of Human, we see the struggles this modern artisan faces, and we get a taste of what it’s like to run a small business while balancing both his passion for motorcycles and his family life. </p>

For this edition, Lawrence Mesich explains his video sculpture &#8220;Distributed Risk,&#8221; a commentary on the financial crisis.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The image in my head for <em>Distributed Risk</em> was the facade of One Court Square stretched across four successively smaller video monitors that attached to a free standing sculpture made of steel beams, with the building moving upwards at a slow, constant crawl. I wanted this piece to address the financial crisis, and an infinitely tall building seemed to embody the persistent fantasy of perpetual growth that grips the financial industry whenever a market bubble is about to burst. The video is like a perverse data visualization, with the building as bar graph.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I made a 2D vector drawing of the structure using Illustrator and used that to work out an initial design, then used that drawing to make a 3D mock up. I spec&#8217;d out materials &#8211; a set of monitors, media players, and steel for the structure &#8211; to figure out the scale and what it what it would cost. The answers were ‘big’ and ‘expensive’. So I applied for a grant through Queens Council on the Arts. I wanted a compelling image for the application. The 3D mock up felt flat, and I thought building a model and photographing it would make a better image.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It turned out to be much more useful. It helped me work out the scale of the materials (2” angle and flat bar) and the position of the monitors, which I decided to cantilever out from the structure. It also helped me work out how to make it modular (mending plates and bolts). I made it at 1:6 the scale of the drawing, or 23” high. I set it up in a diorama and photographed it. I waited about 10 weeks for a response and took a break from the piece. It took me about a month to find a fabricator to work with, and I shopped for monitors and made new diagrams while I asked around. A friend referred me to sculptor Cody Hughes, who agreed to help me make the structure. The monitors got delivered around the same time. It took another month or so to refine the diagram and work out design problems. The most difficult issue was figuring out how to attach the monitors to the structure and keep them aligned. I also wanted to make frames for the monitors but hadn’t worked out how. It took us another month of prototyping different designs before we had a solution. Once that was done, Cody started cutting and welding and I started working on the videos. Practicing on the model turned out to be important. We worked from a 1:1 scale vector drawing that we used as a reference for all of the measurements and assumed an ⅛” tolerance. I worked out the exterior angle of the building image by laying out and measuring the monitors in my studio. I took new photos of One Court Square and made a composite section that I could use to make it [look like] a continuous, creeping surface. I made another scale diagram to line up the video to each other, and the tests worked perfectly.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Cody and I kept making, trading and adjusting diagrams while he cut and welded and I finished the videos. I planned to show the piece during Bushwick Open Studios and we were uncomfortably close to the deadline. We assembled it in my studio over two days and finished it with about fourteen hours to spare.</p></blockquote>
