This creative inevitability is at the center of artistic endeavor and has been articulated by a multitude of humanity&#8217;s most celebrated artists. <em>&#8220;Every good artist paints what he is,&#8221;</em> Jackson Pollock asserted in <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/04/09/jackson-pollock-selden-rodman-conversations-with-artists/">his final interview</a>.</p>
<p>So why, then, do we so readily reduce works of art to objects and commodities, forgetting that they are at heart transfigurations of lived human experience?</p>
<p>My recent <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/05/amanda-palmer-strung-out-in-heaven/">conversation with Amanda Palmer about patronage and the future of art</a> reminded me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-as-Experience-John-Dewey/dp/0399531971/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Art as Experience</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/art-as-experience/oclc/527798&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; a terrific little book by the pioneering philosopher, psychologist, and education reformer <strong>John Dewey</strong> (October 20, 1859&ndash;June 1, 1952), based on a series of ten lectures he delivered at Harvard in the winter and spring of 1931, in which he addresses this very question.</p>
<p>In the opening essay, titled &#8220;The Live Creature,&#8221; Dewey argues that by reducing works of art to material products &#8212; paintings, buildings, books, music albums &#8212; we forget that &#8220;the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience.&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-as-Experience-John-Dewey/dp/0399531971/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/johndewey4.jpg?w=680" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Considering the need to &#8220;restore the continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings&#8221; of the human experience, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance&#8230; Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort, undergoing, and achievement.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In order to <em>understand</em> the esthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw; in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear of man, arousing his interest and affording him enjoyment as he looks and listens: the sights that hold the crowd &#8212; the fire-engine rushing by; the machines excavating enormous holes in the earth; the human-fly climbing the steeple-side; the men perched high in air on girders, throwing and catching red-hot bolts. The sources of art in human experience will be learned by him who sees how the tense grace of the ball-player infects the onlooking crowd; who notes the delight of the housewife in tending her plants, and the intent interest of her goodman in tending the patch of green in front of the house; the zest of the spectator in poking the wood burning on the hearth and in watching the darting flames and crumbling coals.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The intelligent mechanic engaged in his job, interested in doing well and finding satisfaction in his handiwork, caring for his materials and tools with genuine affection, is artistically engaged.</p></blockquote>
<p>What severed this intimate relationship between art and experience, Dewey argues, is the rise of capitalism, which removed art from life by making it a commodity of class, status, or taste. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Objects that were in the past valid and significant because of their place in the life of a community now function in isolation from the conditions of their origin. By that fact they are also set apart from common experience, and serve as insignia of taste and certificates of special culture.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[This is] deeply affecting the practice of living, driving away esthetic preconceptions that are necessary ingredients of happiness, or reducing them to the level of compensating transient pleasurable excitations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Art in its proper form, Dewey suggests, transmutes the common activities of human life into matters of aesthetic value. Any theory seeking an understanding of art must therefore be concerned with understanding the larger ecosystem of experience from which art springs. In a sentiment that calls to mind Richard Feynman&#8217;s memorable <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/">&#8220;ode to a flower&#8221;</a> &#8212; a parallel that exposes the common ground between true science and true art &#8212; Dewey observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flowers can be enjoyed without knowing about the interactions of soil, air, moisture, and seeds of which they are the result. But they cannot be <em>understood</em> without taking just these interactions into account &#8212; and theory is a matter of understanding.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It is a commonplace that we cannot direct, save accidentally, the growth and flowering of plants, however lovely and enjoyed, without understanding their causal conditions. It should be just a commonplace that esthetic understanding &#8212; as distinct from sheer personal enjoyment &#8212; must start with the soil, air, and light out of which things esthetically admirable arise. And these conditions are the conditions and factors that make an ordinary experience complete.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dewey&#8217;s most salient point &#8212; a point that applies not only to art but to our deepest sense of ourselves as agents of aliveness &#8212; deals precisely with this question of completeness. Life, like art, is never complete without what he so poetically calls &#8220;all the rhythmic crises that punctuate the stream of living.&#8221; Our creaturely destiny is intimately entwined with the realities of nature, and nature is forever oscillating between mutually necessary highs and lows. Echoing Nietzsche&#8217;s immortal wisdom on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/15/nietzsche-on-difficulty/">why a fulfilling life requires embracing rather than running from difficulty</a>, Dewey writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The career and destiny of a living being are bound up with its interchanges with its environment.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Life grows when a temporary falling out is a transition to a more extensive balance of the energies of the organism with those of the conditions under which it lives.</p>
<p>These biological commonplaces are something more than that; they reach to the roots of the esthetic in experience. The world is full of things that are indifferent and even hostile to life; the very processes by which life is maintained tend to throw it out of gear with its surroundings. Nevertheless, if life continues and if in continuing it expands, there is an overcoming of factors of opposition and conflict; there is a transformation of them into differentiated aspects of a higher power and more significant life&#8230; Here in germ are balance and harmony attained through rhythm. Equilibrium comes about not mechanically and inertly but out of, and because of, tension&#8230; Changes interlock and sustain one another. Wherever there is this coherence there is endurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sentiment that calls to mind children&#8217;s literature patron saint Ursula Nordstrom &#8212; <em>&#8220;That is the creative artist &#8212; a penalty of the creative artist,&#8221;</em> she wrote in her <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/06/10/ursula-nordstrom-letter-maurice-sendak/">beautiful letter of encouragement</a> to a young and insecure Maurice Sendak, <em>&#8220;wanting to make order out of chaos.&#8221;</em> &#8212; Dewey adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Order is not imposed from without but is made out of the relations of harmonious interactions that energies bear to one another. Because it is active&#8230;order itself develops&#8230; Order cannot but be admirable in a world constantly threatened with disorder.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>For only when an organism shares in the ordered relations of its environment does it secure the stability essential to living. And when the participation comes after a phase of disruption and conflict, it bears within itself the germs of a consummation akin to the esthetic.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/the-little-gardener-emily-hughes/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/thelittlegardener_emilyhughes8.jpg?w=600" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art by Emily Hughes from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/the-little-gardener-emily-hughes/"><em>Little Gardener</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The artist &#8212; that is, the creatively whole human being &#8212; is one who embraces this harmonious interplay, with both its positive and negative energies. Dewey writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the artist cares in a peculiar way for the phase of experience in which union is achieved, he does not shun moments of resistance and tension. He rather cultivates them, not for their own sake but because of their potentialities, brining to living consciousness and experience that is unified and total.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking to what Alan Lightman would so lyrically term <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/10/alan-lightman-a-sense-of-the-mysterious-1">the &#8220;creative sympathies&#8221; of art and science</a> many decades later, Dewey considers the deep commonalities beneath the surface contrasts between these two modes of understanding human experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>In contrast with the person whose purpose is esthetic, the [scientist] is interested in problems, in situations wherein tension between the matter of observation and of thought is marked. Of course he cares for their resolution. But he does not rest in it; he passes on to another problem using an attained solution only as a stepping stone from which to set on foot further inquiries.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The odd notion that an artist does not think and a scientific inquirer does nothing else is the result of converting a difference of tempo and emphasis into a difference in kind. The thinker has his esthetic moment when his ideas case to be mere ideas and become the corporate meanings of objets. The artist has his problems and thinks as he works. Bu this thought is more immediately embodied in the object. Because of the comparative remoteness of his end, the scientific worker operates with symbols, words and mathematical signs. The artist does his thinking in the very qualitative media he works in, and the terms lie so close to the object that he is producing that they merge directly into it.</p></blockquote>
<p>With this, Dewey returns to the indelible interchanges between the human animal and its environment, out of which arises the experience that becomes art &#8212; experience that encompasses the full spectrum of darkness and light, ever-flowing into one another. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Direct experience comes from nature and man interacting with each other. In this interaction, human energy gathers, is released, dammed up, frustrated and victorious. There are rhythmic beats of want and fulfillment, pulses of doing and being withheld from doing.</p>
<p>All interactions that effect stability and order in the whirling flux of change are rhythms. There is ebb and flow, systole and diastole: ordered change&#8230; Contrast of lack and fullness, of struggle and achievement, of adjustment after consummated irregularity, form the drama in which action, feeling, and meaning are one. The outcome is balance and counterbalance.</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_49032"  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/20/mister-horizontal-miss-vertical/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/misterhorizontalmissvertical4.jpg?w=500" alt="" width="600" height="436" class="aligncenter size-full" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by Olimpia Zagnoli for <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/20/mister-horizontal-miss-vertical/"><em>Mister Horizontal &#038; Miss Vertical</em></a> by Noémie Révah</figcaption></figure>
<p>This dance of balance and counterbalance, Dewey reminds us, is the beauty of life and a function of life&#8217;s singular conditions &#8212; it is possible neither in a world of frantic flux without rhythm, nor in a static world calcified into immutability: </p>
<blockquote><p>In a world of mere flux, change would not be cumulative; it would not move toward a close. Stability and rest would have no being. Equally it is true, however, that a world that is finished, ended, would have no traits of suspense and crisis, and would offer no opportunity for resolution. Where everything is already complete, there is no fulfillment&#8230; The live being recurrently loses and reestablishes equilibrium with his surroundings. The moment of passage from disturbance into harmony is that of intensest life. In a finished world, sleep and waking could not be distinguished. In one wholly perturbed, conditions could not even be struggled with. In a world made after the pattern of ours, moments of fulfillment punctuate experience with rhythmically enjoyed intervals.</p>
<p>Inner harmony is attained only when, by some means, terms are made with the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>But because the highs of life are so intoxicating &#8212; from the scintillating sensory pleasure of the perfect chocolate cake to the deep gratification of professional achievement &#8212; we sell ourselves short of completeness, warping this vital rhythm by tipping over into excess, which is invariably deadening to the spirit. A few years before Henry Miller&#8217;s timelessly insightful meditation on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/04/henry-miller-on-money/">how the hedonic treadmill of material rewards entraps us</a>, Dewey admonishes against this deadening effect of reaching for further and further highs while running from the lows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Happiness and delight &#8230; come to be through a fulfillment that reaches to the depths of our being &#8212; one that is an adjustment of our whole being with the conditions of existence. In the process of living, attainment of a period of equilibrium is at the same time the initiation of a new relation to environment, one that brings with its potency of new adjustments to be made through struggle. The time of consummation is also one of beginning anew. Any attempt to perpetuate beyond its term the enjoyment attending the time of fulfillment and harmony constitutes withdrawal from the world. Hence it marks the lowering and loss of vitality. But, through the phases of perturbation and conflict, there abides the deep-seated memory of an underlying harmony, the sense of which haunts life like the sense of being founded on a rock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this rhythm is what Edith Wharton meant by <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/10/edith-wharton-happiness-alone/">&#8220;unassailable serenity.&#8221;</a> Its supreme mastery lies in fully inhabiting the present, which requires learning to befriend the pitfalls of our past and the uncertainties of our future &#8212; that is, learning to live with our imperfect and fragile humanity. Dewey captures this beautifully:</p>
<blockquote><p>The live creature adopts its past; it can make friends with even its stupidities, using them as warnings that increase present wariness&#8230; To the being fully alive, the future is not ominous but a promise; it surrounds the present as a halo. It consists of possibilities that are felt as a possession of what is now and here. In life that is truly life, everything overlaps and merges.</p></blockquote>

<p>This merging of experience, Dewey argues in delivering his central point, is the wellspring of art:</p>
<blockquote><p>The happy periods of an experience that is now complete because it absorbs into itself memories of the past and anticipations of the future, come to constitute the esthetic ideal. Only when the past ceases to trouble and anticipations of the future are not perturbing is a being wholly united with his environment and therefore fully alive. Art celebrates with peculiar intensity the moments in which the past reenforces the present and in which the future is a quickening of what now is.</p></blockquote>

<p>But solitude is a state rather than an emotion, and this state contains within itself a vast spectrum of feelings. In one extreme is the vitalizing aloneness that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/01/keats-letters-solitude/">Keats saw as the wellspring of creativity</a>. In the other, the soul-deadening paralysis of loneliness. </p>

<p>Beloved writer <strong>Edith Wharton</strong> (January 24, 1862&ndash;August 11, 1937) captures the bone-deep isolation of the latter in an exquisite extended simile in her 1893 short story <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collected-Stories-Edith-Wharton/dp/0786711124/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank">&#8220;The Fullness of Life&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have sometimes thought that a woman&#8217;s nature is like a great house full of rooms: there is the hall, through which everyone passes in going in and out; the drawing-room, where one receives formal visits; the sitting-room, where the members of the family come and go as they list; but beyond that, far beyond, are other rooms, the handles of whose doors perhaps are never turned; no one knows the way to them, no one knows whither they lead; and in the innermost room, the holy of holies, the soul sits alone and waits for a footstep that never comes.</p></blockquote>
<p>But such is the actual fullness of life: Only by becoming intimately acquainted with the entire spectrum of solitude can we learn to interpolate between the two extremes and to transmute one into the other. </p>
<p>Wharton herself knew this &#8212; years after writing the short story, she extolled the importance of befriending aloneness not in fiction but in facing the fact of her dear friend Mary Berenson&#8217;s suicidal depression. In a letter to Berenson found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Edith-Wharton-Hermione-Lee/dp/0375702873/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Edith Wharton</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/edith-wharton/oclc/73140273&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), the excellent biography by Hermione Lee, Wharton considers solitude not as a maddening lonesomeness but as an anchor of sanity:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe I know the only cure, which is to make one’s center of life inside of one’s self, not selfishly or excludingly, but with a kind of unassailable serenity &#8212; to decorate one’s inner house so richly that one is content there, glad to welcome anyone who wants to come and stay, but happy all the same when one is inevitably alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>For more on how to attain that &#8220;unassailable serenity,&#8221; see this excellent contemporary meditation on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/03/how-to-be-alone-school-of-life/">how to be alone</a>, then revisit poet Wendell Berry on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/17/wendell-berry-pride-despair-solitude/">how solitude amplifies one&#8217;s inner voice</a>.</p>

A physicist and a novelist, and MIT&#8217;s first professor with dual appointments in science and the humanities, he is one of those rare intellectual amphibians who inhabit the worlds of art and science with equal grace. In his incomparable writing, Lightman continually uncovers what he calls the &#8220;creative sympathies&#8221; between these two worlds &#8212; sympathies nowhere more similar than in the singular scintillation of creative breakthrough common to both realms, which he articulates beautifully in the opening essay from his altogether magnificent 2005 collection <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Mysterious-Science-Human-Spirit/dp/1400078199/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>A Sense of the Mysterious: Science and the Human Spirit</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/sense-of-the-mysterious-science-and-the-human-spirit/oclc/55657298&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>

<p>Reflecting on his first love affair with original research as a 22-year-old graduate student at Caltech, Lightman recounts a trying project aimed at procuring &#8220;a giant umbrella theory of gravity&#8221; by writing down countless equations. However much he toiled, the calculations just didn&#8217;t add up. For months, his pencil trembled with the sense that something was off, but the source of the error evaded him. </p>
<p>And then, much like the periodic table arranged itself in Mendeleev&#8217;s unconscious mind <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/08/mendeleev-periodic-table-dream/">during a dream</a>, the breakthrough arrived in accordance with Lewis Carroll&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/04/lewis-carroll-creative-block-letter/">remedy for creative block</a>. Lightman describes that miraculous moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>One morning, I remember that it was a Sunday morning, I woke up about five a.m. and couldn’t sleep. I felt terribly excited. Something strange was happening in my mind. I was thinking about my research problem, and I was seeing deeply into it. I was seeing it in ways I never had before. The physical sensation was that my head was lifting off my shoulders. I felt weightless. And I had absolutely no sense of my self. It was an experience completely without ego, without any thought about consequences or approval or fame. Furthermore, I had no sense of my body. I didn’t know who I was or where I was. I was simply spirit, in a state of pure exhilaration.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/17/william-blake-dante-divine-comedy/"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blake_divinecomedy18.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">One of William Blake&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/17/william-blake-dante-divine-comedy/">drawings for Dante&#8217;s <em>Divine Comedy</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Psychologists have termed this state <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/05/peter-turchi-a-muse-a-maze-book-flow/">&#8220;flow.&#8221;</a> But although the resulting breakthrough is the fruit of the lengthy labor preceding it &#8212; one ripened by what T.S. Eliot called <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/26/t-s-eliot-on-creativity/">the &#8220;incubation&#8221; at the root of creativity</a> &#8212; when it arrives, it feels like an unmerited grace. Lightman captures this intoxicating feeling:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best analogy I’ve been able to find for that intense feeling of the creative moment is sailing a round-bottomed boat in strong wind. Normally, the hull stays down in the water, with the frictional drag greatly limiting the speed of the boat. But in high wind, every once in a while the hull lifts out of the water, and the drag goes instantly to near zero. It feels like a great hand has suddenly grabbed hold and flung you across the surface like a skimming stone. It’s called planing.</p></blockquote>
<p>That Sunday morning, he woke up planing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although I had no sense of my ego, I did have a feeling of rightness. I had a strong sensation of seeing deeply into the problem and understanding it and knowing that I was right &#8212; a certain kind of inevitability. With these sensations surging through me, I tiptoed out of my bedroom, almost reverently, afraid to disturb whatever strange magic was going on in my head, and I went to the kitchen. There, I sat down at my ramshackle kitchen table. I got out the pages of my calculations, by now curling and stained. A tiny bit of daylight was starting to seep through the window.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sentiment that calls to mind Hemingway&#8217;s admonition to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/03/21/ernest-hemingway-1954-nobel-speech/">work alone</a>, Agnes Martin&#8217;s assertion that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/03/22/agnes-martin-1997-interview/">&#8220;the best things in life happen to you when you’re alone,&#8221;</a> and Keats&#8217;s exaltation of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/01/keats-letters-solitude/">solitude as the seedbed of the imagination</a>, Lightman adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although I was oblivious to myself, my body, and everything around me, the fact is I was completely alone. I don’t think any other person in the world would have been able to help me at that moment. And I didn’t want any help. I had all of these sensations and revelations going on in my head, and being alone with all that was an essential part of it.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/02/the-raven-lou-reed-lorenzo-mattotti/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/loureedraven3.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art by Lorenzo Mattotti for <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/02/the-raven-lou-reed-lorenzo-mattotti/">Lou Reed&#8217;s adaptation of Poe&#8217;s <em>The Raven</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>At that solitary kitchen table, Lightman finally solved his problem and proved that that the conjecture at the heart of his theory was true. He would go on to have similar revelations over the years, not only in other scientific projects but also in his work as a novelist. He writes of this supreme testament to the common creative force animating art and science:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a novelist, I’ve experienced the same sensation. When I suddenly understand a character I’ve been struggling with, or find a lovely way of describing a scene, I am lifted out of the water, and I plane. I’ve read the accounts of other writers, musicians, and actors, and I think that the sensation and process are almost identical in all creative activities. The pattern seems universal: The study and hard work. The prepared mind. The being stuck. The sudden shift. The letting go of control. The letting go of self.</p></blockquote>
<p>This act of letting go, Lightman suggests, is a surrender to the mystery of life. With an eye to Einstein&#8217;s famous proclamation, he considers the meaning of the mysterious:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that [Einstein] meant a sense of awe, a sense that there are things larger than us, that we do not have all the answers at this moment. A sense that we can stand right at the edge between known and unknown and gaze into that cavern and be exhilarated rather than frightened&#8230; I have experienced that beautiful mystery both as a physicist and as a novelist. As a physicist, in the infinite mystery of physical nature. As a novelist, in the infinite mystery of human nature and the power of words to portray some of that mystery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lightman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Mysterious-Science-Human-Spirit/dp/1400078199/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>A Sense of the Mysterious</em></strong></a> remains one of the finest, most poetic science books ever written.

And yet, even as scientists are exploring <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/24/the-depths-rottenberg-depression/">the evolutionary origins of depression</a> and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/08/13/the-twenty-four-hour-mind-rosalind-cartwright/">the role REM sleep may play in it</a>, understanding and articulating the experience of the disease remains a point of continual frustration for those afflicted and a point of continual perplexity for those fortunate never to have plummeted to the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>No one has captured this perennial plague of the human spirit with greater vividness and acuity than <strong>William Styron</strong> (June 11, 1925&ndash;November 1, 2006) in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darkness-Visible-Madness-William-Styron/dp/0679736395/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Darkness Visible</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/darkness-visible-a-memoir-of-madness/oclc/21442999&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; his trenchant 1990 memoir of depression. </p>

<p>Styron, who first descended into clinical depression at the age of sixty and describes himself as &#8220;one who has suffered from the malady in extremis yet returned to tell the tale,&#8221; considers the cultural baggage of this &#8220;veritable howling tempest in the brain,&#8221; propelled by &#8220;the intermingled factors of abnormal chemistry, behavior and genetics&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was first aware that I had been laid low by the disease, I felt a need, among other things, to register a strong protest against the word “depression.” Depression, most people know, used to be termed “melancholia,” a word which appears in English as early as the year 1303 and crops up more than once in Chaucer, who in his usage seemed to be aware of its pathological nuances. “Melancholia” would still appear to be a far more apt and evocative word for the blacker forms of the disorder, but it was usurped by a noun with a bland tonality and lacking any magisterial presence, used indifferently to describe an economic decline or a rut in the ground, a true wimp of a word for such a major illness. It may be that the scientist generally held responsible for its currency in modern times, a Johns Hopkins Medical School faculty member justly venerated &#8212; the Swiss-born psychiatrist Adolf Meyer &#8212; had a tin ear for the finer rhythms of English and therefore was unaware of the semantic damage he had inflicted by offering “depression” as a descriptive noun for such a dreadful and raging disease. Nonetheless, for over seventy-five years the word has slithered innocuously through the language like a slug, leaving little trace of its intrinsic malevolence and preventing, by its very insipidity, a general awareness of the horrible intensity of the disease when out of control.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most striking paradoxes of the disease is that despite its devastating prevalence &#8212; depression is the most common form of disability in the world today &#8212; its symptoms are so imperceptible from the outside that it is extremely difficult to tell who is suffering and who is not. And yet what goes on inside is acute and unmistakable. Styron captures it with penetrating precision:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not an immediately identifiable pain, like that of a broken limb. It may be more accurate to say that despair, owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by the inhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room. And because no breeze stirs this caldron, because there is no escape from this smothering confinement, it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion.</p></blockquote>

Where does it come from and what is its relationship to the wakeful self?</p>
<p>In 1895, the pioneering psychoanalyst <strong>Sigmund Freud</strong> (May 6, 1856&ndash;September 23, 1939) grew intensely preoccupied with this questions and how it might illuminate the psychological significance of dreams. Over the next four years, he incubated the ideas that would become the seminal treatise <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interpretation-Dreams-Complete-Definitive-Text/dp/0465019773/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/interpretation-of-dreams/oclc/544609&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; Freud&#8217;s quest &#8220;to elucidate the processes which underlie the strangeness and obscurity of dreams, and to deduce from these processes the nature of the psychic forces whose conflict or cooperation is responsible for our dreams.&#8221; </p>
<p>Although the evolution of science has challenged many of Freud&#8217;s theories in the century since his heyday, his treatise on dreams was instrumental in paving the way for <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/08/21/dreamland-science-of-sleep-david-randall/">our present understanding of dreams</a>. At the heart of his theory was the idea that dreams spring from wish-fulfillment: We dream about what we dream of &#8212; a proposition that marries the two meanings of <em>dream</em>, the nocturnal wanderings of the unconscious mind and the motivated marches of the conscious will.</p>

<p>In the introduction to the original edition, Freud asserts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of significance, and one which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yet what lends dreams both their abiding allure and their psychological puzzlement is that the link between the two is far from direct, linear, and easily discernible. Freud writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>That all the material composing the content of a dream is somehow derived from experience, that it is reproduced or remembered in the dream &#8212; this at least may be accepted as an incontestable fact. Yet it would be wrong to assume that such a connection between the dream-content and reality will be easily obvious from a comparison between the two. On the contrary, the connection must be carefully sought, and in quite a number of cases it may for a long while elude discovery. The reason for this is to be found in a number of peculiarities evinced by the faculty of memory in dreams.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of this fascinating faculty, Freud asserts:</p>
<blockquote><p>The behavior of memory in dreams is surely most significant for any theory of memory whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marveling at the &#8220;remarkable and theoretically important fact&#8221; that dreams frequently make use of memories inaccessible to the dreamer in the waking state, Freud points out how suggestible the unconscious mind is and how easily impressions are made on it by random images that slip in through the backdoor of our conscious awareness. He illustrates this &#8220;superior knowledge of the dreamer&#8221; with a case study all the more alarming amid today&#8217;s information-overloaded, media-oversaturated cultural landscape:</p>
<blockquote><p>A patient dreamed amongst other things (in a rather long dream) that he ordered a <em>kontuszowka</em> in a cafe, and after telling me this he asked me what it could be, as he had never heard the name before. I was able to tell him that <em>kontuszowka</em> was a Polish liqueur, which he could not have invented in his dream, as the name had long been familiar to me from the advertisements. At first the patient would not believe me, but some days later, after he had allowed his dream of the cafe to become a reality, he noticed the name on a signboard at a street corner which for some months he had been passing at least twice a day.</p></blockquote>
<p>One major source of these consciously inaccessible memories, Freud argues, is our childhood, which leaves vestiges of experience and fragments of memory that provide lifelong material for our dreams. But children themselves, he notes, have dreams that follow the wish-fulfillment paradigm most literally &#8212; what children dream about at night parallels what they dream of in their wakeful wishes. In the child&#8217;s mind, according to this view, the two meanings of &#8220;dream&#8221; converge most closely, which Freud takes as &#8220;proof that the dream, in its inmost essence, is the fulfillment of a wish&#8221;</p>

<p>Counterbalancing these deeply buried memories is our accumulation of fresh ones &#8212; recollections of recent experiences, which we consolidate in dreams. But the consolidation is only possible after a certain distancing from the immediacy of the experience. Freud writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The impressions which have intensely occupied the waking mind appear in dreams only after they have been to some extent removed from the mental activities of the day. Thus, as a rule, we do not dream of a beloved person who is dead while we are still overwhelmed with sorrow.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the most striking feature of dreams is that rather than focusing primarily on such major events as the loss of loved ones, the vast majority of their material is drawn from the most trivial and unremarkable details of our waking lives. This, Freud argues, relates to another perplexity &#8212; the contradiction between the enormous role of memory in the construction of dreams and the fact that we forget most of our dreams upon awaking, all the while being able to remember individual dreams for decades. He observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are often aware that we have been dreaming, but we do not know of what we have dreamed; and we are so well used to this fact &#8212; that the dream is liable to be forgotten &#8212; that we do not reject as absurd the possibility that we may have been dreaming even when, in the morning, we know nothing either of the content of the dream or of the fact that we have dreamed. On the other hand, it often happens that dreams manifest an extraordinary power of maintaining themselves in the memory. I have had occasion to analyze, with my patients, dreams which occurred to them twenty-five years or more previously, and I can remember a dream of my own which is divided from the present day by at least thirty-seven years, and yet has lost nothing of its freshness in my memory. All this is very remarkable, and for the present incomprehensible.</p></blockquote>
<p>The most important cause of forgetting, Freud notes, is the discrepancy between the structural demands of our memory and the unstructured nature of dreams:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order that feelings, representations, ideas and the like should attain a certain degree of memorability, it is important that they should not remain isolated, but that they should enter into connections and associations of an appropriate nature&#8230; Dreams, in most cases, lack sense and order. Dream-compositions, by their very nature, are insusceptible of being remembered, and they are forgotten because as a rule they fall to pieces the very next moment.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The forgetfulness of dreams manifested by the waking consciousness is evidently merely the counterpart of the fact &#8230; that the dream hardly ever takes over an orderly series of memories from the waking state, but only certain details of these memories, which it removes from the habitual psychic connections in which they are remembered in the waking state. The dream-composition, therefore, has no place in the community of the psychic series which fill the mind. It lacks all mnemonic aids.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The different arrangement of the material in the dream makes the dream untranslatable, so to speak, for the waking consciousness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, Freud points out, we remember only fragments of a dream and fill in the rest of the story, succumbing to the same tendency that scientists now know <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/04/oliver-sacks-on-memory-and-plagiarism/">make our conscious memory so malleable and unreliable</a>. He cautions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Partial forgetting is treacherous: for, if one then starts to recount what has not been forgotten, one is likely to supplement from the imagination the incoherent and disjointed fragments provided by the memory&#8230; Unconsciously one becomes an artist, and the story, repeated from time to time, imposes itself on the belief of its author, who, in good faith, tells it as authentic fact, regularly established according to proper methods.</p></blockquote>
<p>Revisiting the heart of his theory &#8212; that dreams are predicated on wish-fulfillment &#8212; Freud writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When, after passing through a narrow defile, one suddenly reaches a height beyond which the ways part and a rich prospect lies outspread in different directions, it is well to stop for a moment and consider whither one shall turn next. We are in somewhat the same position after we have mastered this first interpretation of a dream. We find ourselves standing in the light of a sudden discovery. The dream is not comparable to the irregular sounds of a musical instrument, which, instead of being played by the hand of a musician, is struck by some external force; the dream is not meaningless, not absurd, does not presuppose that one part of our store of ideas is dormant while another part begins to awake&#8230; But at the very moment when we are about to rejoice in this discovery a host of problems besets us. If the dream &#8230; represents a fulfilled wish, what is the cause of the striking and unfamiliar manner in which this fulfillment is expressed?</p></blockquote>
<p>With an eye to the many types of dreams in which the fulfillment of a wish isn&#8217;t easily evident &#8212; a fear borne out, a philosophical reflection (like <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/30/behind-the-trees-neil-gaiman-dream-amanda-palmer/">Neil Gaiman&#8217;s dream</a>), a mere rehashing of events past, an anxiety dream (anxiety being, for Freud, the &#8220;most terrible of all the painful emotions&#8221;) &#8212; he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is the dream capable of teaching us something new concerning our internal psychic processes and can its content correct opinions which we have held during the day?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Are there, then dreams other than wish-dreams; or are there none but wish-dreams? It is easy to show that the wish-fulfillment in dreams is often undisguised and easy to recognize, so that one may wonder why the language of dreams has not long since been understood.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/04/david-the-dreamer-bergengren-freud/"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/davidthedreamer10.jpg" width="600" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art by Tom Seidmann-Freud, Freud&#8217;s brilliant and eccentric cross-dressing niece, for the philosophical 1922 children&#8217;s book <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/04/david-the-dreamer-bergengren-freud/" target="_blank"><em>David the Dreamer</em></a> by Ralph Bergengren</figcaption></figure>
<p>Freud notes that the wish-fulfillment aspect of dreams is often so distorted as to be unrecognizable &#8212; what, after all, is the wish in a nightmare? But these distortions, he argues, are a reflection of our tendency to defend ourselves against a dream we find morally unacceptable or practically unattainable &#8212; a kind of protective self-censorship. He considers the interplay of these contradictory forces:</p>
<blockquote><p>In every human being there exist, as the primary cause of dream-formation, two psychic forces (tendencies or systems), one of which forms the wish expressed by the dream, while the other exercises a censorship over this dream-wish, thereby enforcing on it a distortion. The question is: What is the nature of the authority of this second agency by virtue of which it is able to exercise its censorship? If we remember that the latent dream-thoughts are not conscious before analysis, but that the manifest dream-content emerging from them is consciously remembered, it is not a far-fetched assumption that admittance to the consciousness is the prerogative of the second agency. Nothing can reach the consciousness from the first system which has not previously passed the second instance; and the second instance lets nothing pass without exercising its rights, and forcing such modifications as are pleasing to itself upon the candidates for admission to consciousness. Here we arrive at a very definite conception of the essence of consciousness; for us the state of becoming conscious is a special psychic act, different from and independent of the process of becoming fixed or represented, and consciousness appears to us as a sensory organ which perceives a content proceeding from another source.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, one of the underappreciated cultural contributions of Freud&#8217;s seminal treatise is precisely this question of consciousness, a notion that continues to evade definition even a century later. In discussing the recognizable wish-fulfillment structure of young children&#8217;s dreams, Freud makes an illuminating aside:</p>
<blockquote><p>What animals dream of I do not know. A proverb, for which I am indebted to one of my pupils, professes to tell us, for it asks the question: “What does the goose dream of?”</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a question that immediately calls to mind Philip K. Dick&#8217;s <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> &#8212; a seminal inquiry into how the dilemmas of artificial intelligence challenge our core understanding of ourselves. At the center of the question is the notion that the capacity to dream is intimately entwined with the faculty of consciousness, woven into the very fabric of what it means to be human.</p>

To see better,&#8221;</em> young Susan Sontag <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/25/susan-sontag-on-writing/">wrote in her diary</a>. In solitude, Wendell Berry observed in his <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/17/wendell-berry-pride-despair-solitude/">magnificent meditation on stillness</a>, <em>&#8220;one’s inner voices become audible [and,] in consequence, one responds more clearly to other lives.&#8221;</em> For Keats, solitude was <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/01/keats-letters-solitude/">our greatest conduit to truth and beauty</a>.</p>
<p>But too much solitude, surely, can isolate us and deaden the creative spirit, cutting us off from what Oliver Sacks has called, after David Hume, our essential <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/24/oliver-sacks-gratitude-book/">&#8220;intercourse with the world.&#8221;</a> </p>
<p>This delicate dance between solitude and communion is what the Pulitzer-winning poet <strong>Elizabeth Bishop</strong> (February 8, 1911&ndash;October 6, 1979) explores in a letter found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Words-Air-Complete-Correspondence-Elizabeth/dp/0374531897/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Words in Air: The Complete Correspondence Between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/words-in-air-the-complete-correspondence-between-elizabeth-bishop-and-robert-lowell/oclc/212908838&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; the epistolary record of one of the most beautiful and enduring friendships in creative culture.</p>

<p>In a wink of a letter from July of 1948, Bishop suggests that solitude, like all good things, is only nourishing in moderation and can nauseate in excess:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having just digested all the <em>New York Times</em> and some pretty awful clam-chowder I made for myself, I don&#8217;t feel the slightest bit literary, just stupid. Or maybe it&#8217;s just too much solitude.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few weeks later, she writes to Lowell:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think you said a while ago that I&#8217;d &#8220;laugh you to scorn&#8221; over some conversation you &#038; I had about how to protect oneself against solitude &#038; ennui &#8212; but indeed I wouldn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s just the kind of &#8220;suffering&#8221; I&#8217;m most at home with&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>But as she grows older, she comes to appreciate the nourishment of solitude more and more &#8212; even of extended periods of solitude. Half a century before the trendy modern practice of the periodic sabbatical, 49-year-old Bishop writes to Lowell:</p>
<blockquote><p>You ask if I have ever found &#8220;reading and writing curiously self-sufficient.&#8221; Well, both Lota [Bishop&#8217;s partner, the prominent Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares] and I read from 7 A.M. intermittently until 1 A.M. every day, and all sorts of things, good and bad, and once in a while I think &#8212; what if I should run out of things to read, in English, by the time I&#8217;m sixty and have to spend my old age reading French or Portuguese or even painfully taking up a new language? And then I&#8217;ve always had a day dream of being a light-house keeper, absolutely alone, with no one to interrupt my reading or just sitting, and although such dreams are sternly dismissed at 16 or so they always haunt one a bit, I suppose. I now see a wonderful cold rocky shore in the Falklands, or a house in Nova Scotia on the bay, <em>exactly</em> like my grandmother&#8217;s &#8212; idiotic as it is, and unbearable as the reality would be. But I think everyone should go, or should have gone, through a stretch of it&#8230; Perhaps it is a recurrent need.</p></blockquote>

Among them was novelist, poet, essayist, and playwright <strong>James Baldwin</strong> (August 2, 1924&ndash;December 1, 1987), whom Plimpton had interviewed on two separate occasions in early 1984, half a century after Baldwin <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/10/a-rap-on-race-james-baldwin-reading/">read his way out of Harlem</a> and into the pantheon of literary greatness. </p>
<p>In a fantastic addition to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/03/advice-on-writing/">the collected wisdom of celebrated writers</a>, Baldwin looks back on his formidable career and shares what he has learned about the creative process, the psychological drivers of writing, and the habits of mind one must cultivate in order to excel at the craft.</p>

<p>Reflecting on what motivates great writers to write &#8212; an enduring question also addressed beautifully by <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/06/25/george-orwell-why-i-write/">George Orwell</a>, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/06/the-nature-of-fun-david-foster-wallace/">David Foster Wallace</a>, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/06/10/italo-calvino-on-writing/">Italo Calvino</a>, and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/25/william-faulkner-university-of-virginia-recording/">William Faulkner</a> &#8212; Baldwin <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/10/19/so-you-want-to-be-a-writer-charles-bukowski/">sides with Bukowski</a> and argues that the supreme animating force of the writer is the irrepressible impossibility of not-writing: </p>
<blockquote><p>Something that irritates you and won&#8217;t let you go. That&#8217;s the anguish of it. Do this book, or die. You have to go through that. Talent is insignificant. I know a lot of talented ruins. Beyond talent lie all the usual words: discipline, love, luck, but most of all, endurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Endurance, indeed, is perhaps <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/12/16/writers-wakeup-times-literary-productivity-visualization/">the sole common denominator among successful authors</a>. Any aspiring writer, he admonishes, should have no illusion about the endurance required but should want to write anyway. A generation after Jack Kerouac considered <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/17/are-writers-born-or-made-jack-kerouac/">the vital difference between talent and genius</a>, Baldwin notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if you&#8217;re not going to be a writer nothing I can say will help you. What you really need at the beginning is somebody to let you know that the effort is real.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sentiment reminiscent of Joan Didion&#8217;s observation that she writes <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/10/16/why-i-write-joan-didion/">in order to gain better access to her own mind</a>, Baldwin speaks to the consciousness-clarifying function of the creative impulse:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you&#8217;re writing, you&#8217;re trying to find out something which you don&#8217;t know. The whole language of writing for me is finding out what you don&#8217;t want to know, what you don&#8217;t want to find out. But something forces you to anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much of that self-revelation, Baldwin points out, happens not during the first outpour of writing but during the grueling process of rewriting. Echoing Hemingway&#8217;s abiding wisdom on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/04/with-hemingway-arnold-samuelson-writing/">the crucial art of revision</a>, he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rewriting [is] very painful. You know it&#8217;s finished when you can&#8217;t do anything more to it, though it&#8217;s never exactly the way you want it&#8230; The hardest thing in the world is simplicity. And the most fearful thing, too. You have to strip yourself of all your disguises, some of which you didn&#8217;t know you had. You want to write a sentence as clean as a bone. That is the goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>But as essential as that sense of incompleteness may be in guiding the revision process, it must be mediated by the awareness that completeness is a perennial mirage. (Decades later, Zadie Smith would observe in <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/19/zadie-smith-10-rules-of-writing/">her ten rules of writing</a>: <em>“Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never ­being satisfied.”</em>) Baldwin offers:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you&#8217;ve finished a novel, it means, &#8220;The train stops here, you have to get off here.&#8221; You never get the book you wanted, you settle for the book you get. I&#8217;ve always felt that when a book ended there was something I didn&#8217;t see, and usually when I remark the discovery it&#8217;s too late to do anything about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Adding to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/20/daily-routines-writers/">the endlessly fascinating daily rhythms of great writers</a>, which reflect the wide range of differences in <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/08/25/the-psychology-of-writing-daily-routine/">the cognitive conditions of the ideal writing routine</a>, Baldwin shares his work habits:</p>
<blockquote><p>I start working when everyone has gone to bed. I&#8217;ve had to do that ever since I was young &#8212; I had to wait until the kids were asleep. And then I was working at various jobs during the day. I&#8217;ve always had to write at night. But now that I&#8217;m established I do it because I&#8217;m alone at night.</p></blockquote>

<p><img width="320" height="482" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleyevsdream.jpg?fit=320%2C482" class="cover alignright size-medium" alt="How Mendeleev Invented His Periodic Table in a Dream" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleyevsdream.jpg?resize=320%2C482 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleyevsdream.jpg?w=331 331w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p><p>Trailblazing chemist <strong>Dmitri Mendeleev</strong> (February 8, 1834&ndash;February 2, 1907) came to scientific greatness via an unlikely path, overcoming towering odds to create the periodic table foundational to our understanding of chemistry. Born in Siberia as one of anywhere between 11 and 17 children &#8212; biographical accounts differ, as infant mortality rate in the era was devastatingly high &#8212; he was immersed in tragedy from an early age. His father was a professor of fine arts, philosophy, and politics, but grew blind and lost his teaching position. His mother became the sole breadwinner, working at a glass factory. When Dmitri was thirteen, his father died. Two years later, a fire destroyed the glass factory. </p>
<p>The following year, determined to ensure her son&#8217;s education, his mother took him across the country hoping to get him into a good university. The University of Moscow rejected him. At last, they made it to Saint Petersburg, Russia&#8217;s then-capital. Saint Petersburg University &#8212; his father&#8217;s alma mater and, incidentally, both of my parents&#8217; &#8212; admitted him and the family relocated there despite their poverty. </p>
<p>A promising scholar, Mendeleev &#8212; also spelled Mendeleyev in English &#8212; published papers by the time he was 20 and attended the world&#8217;s first chemistry conference at 26. By his mid-thirties, he was intensely preoccupied with classifying the 56 elements known by that point. He struggled to find an underlying principle that would organize them according to sets of similar properties and eventually reaped the benefits of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/04/the-ravenous-brain-daniel-bor/">the pattern-recognition that fuels creativity</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/MENDELEYEVS-DREAM-ELEMENTS-PAUL-STRATHERN/dp/024114065X/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-52406"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleev.jpg?resize=680%2C955" alt="mendeleev" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52406" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleev.jpg?resize=240%2C337 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleev.jpg?resize=320%2C450 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleev.jpg?resize=768%2C1079 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleev.jpg?resize=600%2C843 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mendeleev.jpg?w=1134 1134w" sizes="(max-width: 1134px) 100vw, 1134px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But rather than by willful effort, he arrived at his creative breakthrough by the unconscious product of what T.S. Eliot called <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/09/26/t-s-eliot-on-creativity/">idea-incubation</a> &#8212; one February evening, after a wearying day of work, Mendeleev envisioned his periodic table in a dream.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MENDELEYEVS-DREAM-ELEMENTS-PAUL-STRATHERN/dp/024114065X/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Mendeleyev&#8217;s Dream: The Quest for the Elements</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/mendeleyevs-dream-the-quest-for-the-elements/oclc/49726503&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), novelist <strong>Paul Strathern</strong> reconstructs the landmark moment from the scientist&#8217;s letters and diaries, and reimagines it with a dose of satisfying literary flourishing:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Mendeleyev’s eyes ran once more along the line of ascending atomic weights, he suddenly noticed something that quickened his pulse. Certain similar properties seemed to repeat in the elements, at what appeared to be regular numerical intervals. Here was something! But what? A few of the intervals began with a certain regularity, but then the pattern just seemed to peter out. Despite this, Mendeleyev soon became convinced that he was on the brink of a major breakthrough. There was a definite pattern there somewhere, but he just couldn’t quite grasp it&#8230; Momentarily overcome by exhaustion, Mendeleyev leaned forward, resting his shaggy head on his arms. Almost immediately he fell asleep, and had a dream.</p></blockquote>
<p>The dream, of course, was just a function of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/16/the-science-of-dreams-and-why-we-have-nightmares/">what the human brain normally does during sleep</a> &#8212; organizing and consolidating the ideas, images, and bits of information that occupy our waking hours. And what Mendeleev&#8217;s waking mind was so vigorously occupied with was the quest for a classification system that would order the elements. &#8220;It’s all formed in my head,&#8221; he lamented, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t express it.&#8221; It was only when he reentered his own head under the spell of sleep&#8217;s uninhibited state that the disjointed bits fell into a pattern and the larger idea expressed itself. </p>
<p>Mendeleev himself would recount in his diary:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper.</p></blockquote>

It was astonishing to observe the immediate and intense global outpour of grief for this artist who had inspired and emboldened generations of creative rebels. Among them was friend and kindred spirit <a href="http://amandapalmer.net/" target="_blank">Amanda Palmer</a>, who was moved to channel her mourning into a spontaneous secret project now released as <a href="http://amandapalmer.net/strungoutinheaven/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Strung Out In Heaven: A Bowie String Quartet Tribute</em></strong></a> &#8212; six sublime covers of beloved Bowie songs with string arrangements by <a href="http://www.jherekbischoff.com/" target="_blank">Jherek Bischoff</a> and vocals by Amanda, featuring appearances by Neil Gaiman, Anna Calvi, and John Cameron Mitchell, and original artwork for each of the tracks by six different visual artists. </p>
<p>Because Amanda&#8217;s art, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/donate/">like <em>Brain Pickings</em></a>, is supported via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/amandapalmer?ty=h" target="_blank">direct patronage from her audience</a>, she had the agility to release this record on a remarkable timeline, translating an idea into art in less than two weeks &#8212; a pace that would have been impossible under a traditional record label. </p>
<p>The project is also a supremely heartening testament to what art can do and be in its highest, purest form &#8212; born out of an artist&#8217;s irrepressible creative impulse to pay homage to her departed hero, giving voice to her audience&#8217;s shared grief and gratitude, funded entirely by that audience, and released back into the world under a true art-for-everybody ethos at only $1 per download. More than half of the proceeds go back to the David Bowie estate and all remaining proceeds from the first month of sales go toward the cancer research wing of Tufts Medical Center in memory of Bowie.</p>

<p>On the day of the release, I sat down with Amanda for a conversation about the rewards and challenges of replacing the commercial model of art with a patronage model, the indivisible unity of the artist&#8217;s life and the artist&#8217;s art, and how the profound cultural shifts since Bowie&#8217;s heyday have changed the way artists and audiences connect around art.  </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MP:</strong> A few years ago, Bowie <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/10/david-bowie-proust-questionnaire-vanity-fair/">answered the Proust Questionnaire</a>. When asked who his real-life heroes were, he responded: “The consumer.” Perhaps he was just being facetious, but in a way it’s a rather literal answer &#8212; while he made a career out of being a sort of space oddity, a creative weirdo not even marching to his own drum but inventing a whole new space-instrument to march to, he was also very much conscious of his reach and aware of his audience, incredibly savvy in engineering commercial appeal, and he even pioneered the commercial debt security model known as a &#8220;celebrity bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now here you come, paying tribute to Bowie, as an artist who has replaced the consumer model with the patron model. You too are doing your very own thing, making art out of being a space oddity, and yet you&#8217;re funding it in an entirely different way. Were you conscious of the contrasts and parallels between the two of you while recording this EP? </p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> I actually was, because the minute he died and everyone was doing their Bowie think-pieces and recirculating all of his old interviews, one of the things that came at me was people flagging me down and saying, &#8220;Oh, look, David Bowie presaged everything that you&#8217;re doing now.&#8221; David Bowie looked into the Magic 8 ball of the Internet and could see where everything was headed, 15 years ago &#8212; because David Bowie was really smart. </p>
<p>And so when David Bowie said that his hero is the consumer, I think a lot of it semantics &#8212; how is he defining &#8220;hero,&#8221; and how is he defining &#8220;consumer&#8221;? Because I think David Bowie and I, in the Venn diagram of music and performance world, have mostly overlap. But, like many of my other heroes &#8212; like Morrissey, like Robert Smith, like &#8230; name a titan of the dark nineties &#8212; he learned how to learn a system that is now defunct, and he became an expert in using the music industry, as they all did. </p>
<p>I was recently talking to Hasit Shah from Harvard&#8217;s Berkman Center, who is writing an article about Prince and the Internet for NPR. We had this long conversation about why everyone is constantly looking at Prince and saying, &#8220;Uhhh, he&#8217;s a grumpy old man.&#8221; I look at that entire era of musicians whom we all worshipped for decades, who are now they&#8217;re getting into their sixties. A lot of people look at them as grumpy old people, but I look at them as a kind of tragedy &#8212; because they spent their <em>lives</em> becoming fluent in a language that&#8217;s no longer spoken. And it&#8217;s no wonder that they&#8217;re upset &#8212; they spent their lives learning how to game a particular system that then collapsed as soon as they were ready to retire. If you were going to make music in 1985, you looked at the system and figured out what your options were. Very few people decided to change the system. 99.99999% said, &#8220;okay, I&#8217;m going to find a record label to sign with&#8221; &#8212; because that was the method of distribution in 1985.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>MP:</strong> This makes me think of Simone Weil, who <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/24/simone-weil-on-science-necessity-and-the-love-of-god/">wrote in the early 1940s</a>: “When someone exposes himself as a slave in the market place, what wonder if he finds a master?”</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Prince famously wrote &#8220;SLAVE&#8221; on his face when he was trying to get off his record label.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> How perfect! But now, the &#8220;consumer&#8221; who was Bowie&#8217;s hero is in many ways behaving like a slave in the marketplace and finding a master, in terms the kinds of things we consent to as audiences in an increasingly commercial culture.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Well, yes, but if you look at tens of thousands of years of human history as three people &#8212; the audience, the artist, and the guy at the door &#8212; there have been countless iterations of how that can work. The interesting thing about our relationship with art after the emergence of music as recorded artifact is that we can &#8220;have&#8221; it &#8212; we can own it. We forget constantly that this relationship is really new. Music in the past was not haveable &#8212; it was playable, it was sharable, you could buy sheet music. Our whole relationship with music as something you can hold in your hand &#8212; you can put on your record player, you can play on your iPhone &#8212; is very new. And we&#8217;re all very confused right now, but I do think the pendulum is eventually going to swing back into the world of music being not something you have and own but something you share and you convene around, music as community glue. And that&#8217;s going to mean the simultaneous death of the superstar &#8212; it&#8217;s going to mean the death of the David Bowie types who can sell millions and millions and millions of records and be glorified by a system that no longer exists.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="680" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F245412950&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=680&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MP:</strong> What&#8217;s interesting is that there was another turning point that paralleled the phenomenon of haveness &#8212; the moment at which music became haveable &#8212; and that&#8217;s the emergence of the mass market and capitalism&#8217;s transactionalist culture as related to the arts. That&#8217;s also when patronage plummeted and the man at the door became advertising and its kindred forms of commercial middlemanning between artist and audience. And the backlash you&#8217;re describing, this return to non-haveable experiences, is paralleled by a backlash of the audience moving toward a patronage model &#8212; you being a trailblazing example &#8212; and telling the man at the door to go away, refusing to allow a middleman to meddle in the experience of art. I wonder how these two shifts fed into and off of each other.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> It&#8217;s a really good question &#8212; it&#8217;s so fascinating, now. Even five years ago, people had ideas about where the money was going to come from in the music industry and in music culture and to the artists, and even just post-Napster, people&#8217;s theories have been <em>really</em> wrong. I made the case early on that if you set the Internet up like the street, music could work a lot like busking &#8212; because your average appreciator wants to pay, which is what you&#8217;ve found with <em>Brain Pickings</em>. And a lot of it is context &#8212; personness and not corporateness.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> And the values that you&#8217;re supporting in addition to the art &#8212; which brings us to the curious question of people bringing the market mentality to the patronage model. You experienced this recently with a fan.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Right. A woman tweeted that she had withdrawn her patronage from my Patreon because she was &#8220;livid&#8221; that I was donating &#8220;her&#8221; money &#8212; also known as my salary &#8212; to the Bernie Sanders campaign, vocally. It turned into a discussion of whether or not she would feel the same way if I was an iTunes artist and she was just throwing down a dollar for my latest single and I was then taking the profit and giving it to anything &#8212; any charitable cause, any politician &#8212; because that would be my prerogative. </p>
<p>What I found was what I expected to find &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t a single person on Twitter who took the position of this woman, in part because I&#8217;ve been trying to educate and expound on what patronage is going to mean now, in these Internet days.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="680" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F245412905&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=680&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MP:</strong> Perhaps the pivotal educational moment came when you did your magnificent <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/26/amanda-palmer-motherhood-letter/">BBC open letter</a> to the fan who said she wanted to withdraw her patronage now that you were going to be a mother, because she had signed on to support your art and not your baby&#8217;s diapers, and you wrote beautifully about how your art is inseparable from your baby&#8217;s diapers &#8212; from your life as a human being in its entirety.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Right. The blurred line between the artist and the art and the marketing of the art is all just living in one very messy place. People have, since the early days of my career and later through Kickstarter, been giving me money not just for the art but for the whole story &#8212; for my writing on the blogs, and my existence.</p>
<p>One very interesting way to think about it is this: If what my patrons wish for me in their $10 patronage is that I spend my time and energy making art, then if I don&#8217;t buy diapers, I have to spend my whole day just cleaning baby shit off the floor. I&#8217;d have no time to listen to string arrangements and go into a studio. So it <em>is</em> the same thing &#8212; it <em>is</em> all one thing.</p>
<p>And if you wanted to clock the hours that I have spent as communicator, helper, therapist, sharer of ideas with my fans over Twitter and Facebook, it would probably log in the thousands of hours. But I consider that part of the you-ness and the me-ness of what our patrons are paying for. It comes down to this: I want to make everything, I won&#8217;t want to work within a nickel-and-diming capitalist system, and I want you patrons to just generally pay my salary &#8212; which is where things get very complicated with the Patreon model, because a lot of it is somewhat random. For instance: I&#8217;m going to put out a record with my dad this year, and it costs too much time and energy to just put out as one thing, but do I put it out as five things and charge $150,000 for it? That seems a little extreme. Do I put it up as two things, do I split it up into three? And when I start thinking this way, I realize, I have complete control.</p>
<p>I could sit there and take Polaroids and draw on them and put one up a day, and just charge my fans. They would probably stop trusting me and go away. I talked about this so much when the Kickstarter happened &#8212; which happened because people trusted me. And then there was conversation number two, which was about <em>why</em> people trusted me, and that became <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/11/11/amanda-palmer-the-art-of-asking-book/"><em>The Art of Asking</em></a>, because it&#8217;s not a two-sentence answer. But they trusted me because I toured the world for ten years and got to know them &#8212; and people don&#8217;t trust you without getting to know you and watching you work and seeing you make good on your word.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Which is something much larger than art as sellable artifact.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> True. Which brings us back to the art-as-consumable-thing question. Years ago, someone told me about an art service that would repaint classical art in a color scheme that better suits the decor of your house.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> <em>Starry Night</em> with a little more green to match the drapes?</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Exactly. A bizarro-world example of art as product. And one of the questions that keeps coming up in my life, and kept coming up endlessly in the Kickstarter, was people asking whether I feel like I would be beholden to my fans &#8212; which is another way of asking whether I&#8217;m afraid of turning my audience into consumers. And that was so outside the realm of my imagination that it hadn&#8217;t even <em>occurred</em> to me to be worried about that until journalists started asking all the time. And my answer was always &#8220;no.&#8221; I&#8217;m not worried about that because I don&#8217;t have that kind of relationship with my audience &#8212; they&#8217;ve given me their support not because they have an expectation of a particular product that they want to arrive in their inbox, but because they have a curiosity about where my path is going to take me and they want to see what&#8217;s created.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> It seems like what you&#8217;re describing is a shift from an ethic of expectation, which is the market model, to an ethic of enthusiasm, which is the patronage model &#8212; people are just excited to support the artist and to offer up that enthusiasm in tangible form, as a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Right. But the boundaries are also very fluid. When I pitched my audience Patreon, I pitched them a mystery into which we were all going to be going. But, as their art-maker and enthusiasm-provider, there&#8217;s a part of me that just wants to make them happy and delight them and surprise them and impress them and emotionally challenge them. And there&#8217;s a part of me that takes delight in finding new ways to do that rather than just sitting down and writing another delightful, emotionally challenging ukulele song every two weeks for which I get paid &#8212; that would be so fucking boring.</p>
<p>And this, actually, takes us full-circle to Bowie &#8212; because Bowie, like a certain lineage of shape-shifting art-world artists who didn&#8217;t just follow the script, fed off doing the unexpected while not departing so far off to the left that they lost their audience. And that&#8217;s a dance that you do with expectation &#8212; a dance between your audience&#8217;s expectation and the awareness that if you give them what they actually expect, you&#8217;d lose them.</p>
<p>It makes me think of Henry Ford&#8217;s famous remark that if he had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses &#8212; and instead he made a car. His job wasn&#8217;t to give them what they wanted &#8212; it was to give them what they needed.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="680" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F245412892&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=680&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MP:</strong> And yet the commercial music industry today is very much a &#8220;faster horses&#8221; model &#8212; song after song after song, algorithmically optimized to refine what people already know and want. The tricky thing happens when the audience begins expecting a product &#8212; the artist can thrive and grow only when people expect a process. The market model is predicated on product and the patronage model on process.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Getting away from art-as-product reminds me of the <a href="http://breadandpuppet.org/cheap-art/why-cheap-art-manifesto" target="_blank">Bread and Puppet manifesto</a>: &#8220;Art is not business! It does not belong to banks &#038; fancy investors. Art is food. You can&#8217;t eat it but it feeds you.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Or, as Susan Sontag put it in 1964: <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/30/susan-sontag-on-art/">&#8220;Art is a form of nourishment (of consciousness, the spirit).&#8221;</a></p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s the idea that we look at our art-providers as having a logical and valuable job &#8212; like the shoemaker and the doctor and the teacher &#8212; the idea that being a musician is just an ordinary job, as opposed to being an extraordinary job with terrible odds of success, that whole paradigm of how difficult it is to get a job in the arts. Instead, we&#8217;re going to the old way of looking at art and talent, which is that if you want to take that on as a job, you will train and you&#8217;ll get good at it and you&#8217;ll be appreciated, and maybe you won&#8217;t be fabulously wealthy, but nobody should be fabulously wealthy &#8212; not if we&#8217;re all living in a community where things are basically fair.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> In a way, the patronage model is allowing for precisely that &#8212; translating the appreciation of an artist into a tangible recognition of that very ordinary, very important job of feeding the soul of the people by feeding the artist. Which brings us back to the Bowie project.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> When David Bowie died, I wanted to immerse myself in David Bowie and give myself a work project, because I had been so immersed in motherhood and was struggling with reconciling that with my identity as an artist. I wanted desperately to work, but had cleared my plate of projects because I didn&#8217;t know what my life as a mother would be like and I needed to make room for that. So I had this semi-vacuum of time where I was coming to terms with mother-schedule, but I looked at the Bowie tribute and realized I could do most of the project from home, on my computer, in collaboration with Jherek, and I could spend two days at the studio and find a babysitter. I looked at the entire project and thought it was manageable, I could do it right now, which is the way I like to work &#8212; fast and furious and surprising and very chaotic and manic. </p>
<p>Jherek was on board to go with the pace, and I knew that if we waited seven months to put out our David Bowie tribute, it just wouldn&#8217;t feel the same. It is of the moment, and it was of the moment to sit on the couch and listen to Bowie songs with Neil [Gaiman] and read my patrons&#8217; favorite Bowie songs and go on hunts for obscure tracks and sit there with the baby between me and Neil, immersing ourselves in this artist&#8217;s world &#8212; because all that felt like part of the project, it felt like part of the patronage. </p>
<p>That was our way of mourning, and that became our ritualistic David Bowie funeral.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="680" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F245412929&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=680&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MP:</strong> But that pace, that surrender to the moment, wouldn&#8217;t have been possible under a traditional label.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> Right. What I love about Patreon is that I can now work at the pace that I require. If I were doing this at the pace of my old record label, I would have called them in an excited fury and they would now be sitting down in a boardroom, in a meeting, saying, &#8220;If Amanda wants to do this David Bowie tribute, should we try to slot it in release week November 2016, in between Slipknot and Nickleback?&#8221; So there is a staggering liberation in being able to just take a pile of money and make the music happen. And this album won&#8217;t make a lot of money &#8212; it&#8217;s not going to be sold in stores, it&#8217;s only going to be available digitally for $1, more than half of which goes to David Bowie&#8217;s publishing estate. But I didn&#8217;t do it because I wanted to make a lot of money &#8212; I did it because I wanted to do it and I wanted to pay for it and I wanted it to be sustainable. And, hopefully, my Patreon will grow and grow and grow &#8212; and I&#8217;ll continually spend the entire budget back on the art, but that&#8217;s what I always wanted to do anyway.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> But that&#8217;s the point &#8212; that&#8217;s what patronage is.</p>
<p><strong>AP:</strong> That <em>is</em> the point. It&#8217;s about making enough money to make art, and making enough money to live, and making enough money to give to Bernie Sanders if I wanted to. Actually, this is going to be a very interesting question for me in the next five or ten years &#8212; how transparent am I expected to be and how demanding are my patrons going to be, because none of us have ever done this before and there is no rulebook.</p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> Well, in the immortal words of the Talking Heads, we&#8217;ll &#8220;make it up as we go along.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Words-Journals-William-Burroughs/dp/0802137784/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img class="cover" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/burroughslastwords.jpg?w=680" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><em>&#8220;It’s funny that it’s so plain that it’s love that makes the world go round,&#8221;</em> Iris Murdoch wrote in one of her magnificent <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/26/iris-murdoch-love-letters-brigid-brophy/">her love letters</a>, <em>&#8220;although it’s so very difficult to get it right.&#8221;</em> In those rare moments when we&#8217;re able &#8212; or, rather, willing &#8212; to strip away our cynical resistance to sincerity, we can glimpse the plainness of love and relish it as the richest reality of life. </p>
<p>Nothing strips of our self-protective cynicisms more effectively than the approach of death with its inescapable invitation to look back on our days and recognize love as the central animating force that made life worth living. Even <strong>William S. Burroughs</strong> (February 5, 1914&ndash;August 2, 1997) &#8212; a writer whose exceptional genius was undergirded by the lifelong darkness of addiction and personal tragedy &#8212; reached for the light of love at the end of his days. </p>

<p>In a diary entry from March of 1997, found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Words-Journals-William-Burroughs/dp/0802137784/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/last-words-the-final-journals-of-william-s-burroughs/oclc/42022427&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>)&#8211; which also gave us Burroughs <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/05/william-s-burroughs-on-creativity/">on creativity</a> and his <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/06/william-s-burroughs-daily-routine/">his daily routine</a> &#8212; he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>At 83 just emerging from a stormy adolescence, costly to myself and those around me. Of course, no more nonsense “love” at my old age.</p></blockquote>
<p>As he approaches the end, he grows all the more intent on disposing of the nonsense and peering into the reality of love. In an entry penned six weeks before his death, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sounds sappy, but love is a very definite force, like electricity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The very last page of his journal, penned three days before his death, read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only thing can resolve conflict is love&#8230; Pure love.</p>
<p>Love? What is It?<br />
Most natural painkiller what there is.<br />
LOVE.</p></blockquote>

Which is why, once again, information curators matter. They sift through the noise and clutter for us, delivering what&amp;#039;s really worthy of attention and engagement, and sparing us the reckless bouncing between mediocre bits of mostly irrelevant information.&lt;/li&gt;
