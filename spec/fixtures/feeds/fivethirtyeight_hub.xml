				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/monographs/TheAmericanFreshman2015.pdf">new survey</a> that captures the attitudes of 2015 college freshmen shows unprecedented levels of interest in both political engagement and student activism, underscoring the youth vote&#8217;s potential to reshape the electoral landscape. The survey also finds that more of these students identify as liberals, seek to become community leaders and want to influence the political structure.</p><p>The Higher Education Research Institute &#8212; a group based at the University of California, Los Angeles &#8212; polled 141,189 people who represent the country’s full-time, first-year students starting four-year colleges and universities in the fall of 2015. The demographics of college freshmen have changed considerably since the survey was first administered in 1966, and it provides insight into the attitudes of this constituency, which has long puzzled researchers but stands out as a key demographic group for politicians.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/tfsPublications.php">survey</a> found that nearly 9 percent of freshmen say there’s a “very good chance” they’ll participate in a student protest on campus, the highest in the survey’s history and up from about 6 percent in 2014. Black and Latino students were more likely to express this view than white and Asian-American students. (The survey was administered from March 14, 2015, through Oct. 12, 2015, a period in which protests on college campuses were generating some media attention, but was completed a month before black students on the University of Missouri football team <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_missouri/index.html">issued their call</a> for the university system president to step down, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/13/mizzous-impact-is-felt-on-campuses-nationwide/">bringing greater national attention</a> to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/09/racial-tensions-escalate-u-missouri-and-yale">campus protests</a>.)</p><figure id="attachment_104528"class="wp-caption aligncenter "style="max-width: 575px"><a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/tfsPublications.php" rel="attachment wp-att-104528"><img class="size-full wp-image-104528" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-5-58-01-pm.png?w=575&#038;h=307" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-10 at 5.58.01 PM" width="575" height="307" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-5-58-01-pm.png?w=575&amp;h=307 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-5-58-01-pm.png?w=1150&amp;h=307 2x" /></a></figure><p>The survey’s lead author, HERI Managing Director Kevin Eagan, said in an interview that student protests on campus “may not be political in the sense that most people think about politics.” Students may instead “be demonstrating on their campus for greater college affordability; they might be protesting because of acts of racism or racial bias, or sexual assault.” Still, 60 percent of freshmen indicated that they plan to vote in an election while in college &#8212; an increase of 10 percentage points compared with the 2014 survey. (HERI doesn’t have comparable data for freshmen in the 2011-12 school year, when attitudes toward the upcoming presidential election may have been different.)</p><p>From one vantage point, the emboldened political attitudes of these 18- and 19-year-olds mirror a rise in volunteerism and commitment to others also captured in the survey &#8212; offering evidence disputing the view of younger Americans as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201401/why-is-narcissism-increasing-among-young-americans">narcissistic or incurious about the world</a>. The <a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/tfsPublications.php">2015 survey</a> also shows that 40 percent of freshman students believe it is “essential” or “very important” to become community leaders, representing the highest share of students with that opinion in the survey’s history. Nearly three-quarters of those who took the survey indicated that helping others in difficulty is an important goal, the highest such result since the question was first asked in 1966. The importance of improving one’s understanding of other countries and cultures is also at its highest point since the question was first posed in 2002, with almost 60 percent of freshmen saying it’s “very important” or “essential” to them.</p><figure id="attachment_104529"class="wp-caption aligncenter "style="max-width: 575px"><a href="http://www.heri.ucla.edu/tfsPublications.php" rel="attachment wp-att-104529"><img class="size-full wp-image-104529" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-6-05-42-pm.png?w=575&#038;h=275" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-10 at 6.05.42 PM" width="575" height="275" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-6-05-42-pm.png?w=575&amp;h=275 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-6-05-42-pm.png?w=1150&amp;h=275 2x" /></a></figure><p>On some questions about embracing other cultures, however, large disparities exist along racial lines. The report notes that although roughly one-third of white students believe it’s important to promote racial understanding, 53 percent of Latino students and 64 percent of black students felt similarly.</p><p>Tyrone Howard, a scholar at UCLA who studies multiculturalism in education and is unaffiliated with the survey, said it doesn’t surprise him that “students of color who feel the effect of racial discrimination and prejudice would want to see steps taken to increase better racial understanding and coexistence among students.” Concerned Student 1950, the University of Missouri student organization that is credited with touching off the protests on that campus that led to the university system president’s ouster, <a href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/45/345ad844-9f05-5479-9b64-e4b362b4e155/563fd24f5a949.pdf.pdf">issued a list of demands that included</a> more efforts to increase diversity among students and faculty.</p><p>“I don’t think white students see that as much because they’re not a target of that,” Howard added, as a way of explaining the higher percentages of black and Latino students who favor promoting racial understanding. “Seeing people who look like you makes you feel like you belong there, like you’re welcomed there, like you matter there.&#8221;</p><p>The political engagement of college students has been studied before. A 2010 report released by the same UCLA research group found that 75 percent of eligible college freshmen voted <a href="http://heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/briefs/HERI_ResearchBrief_Politics_Oct_2010.pdf">in the 2008 presidential election</a>. That turnout exceeded the nation’s overall voter participation rate, which at 64 percent was the highest since the 1960s. The students’ political punch likely benefited Barack Obama, as 37 percent of the freshmen and seniors captured by the 2010 study identified as liberal, and 24 percent said they were conservative.</p><p>Although the 2008 election that resulted in the nation’s first black president was an outlier in voter turnout, just being on a college campus increases the likelihood that a young person will vote, said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University in Massachusetts. For one thing, “there&#8217;s a huge amount of outreach that focuses on colleges,” Kawashima-Ginsberg said, because “that’s where a lot of the get-out-the-vote and registration resources are focused on, especially when it comes to youth.”</p><p>She also considers university campuses locations where students develop strong attitudes about civic engagement. That in turn may alter the outcomes in certain races. Her center at Tufts recently released a guide to 2016 races where college students <a href="http://civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/YESI-PDF-FINALFINAL.pdf">could have an outsize role </a>and published an analysis suggesting that Sen. Bernie Sanders’ <a href="http://civicyouth.org/college-student-heavy-counties-support-sanders-play-major-role-in-iowa-caucus/">success in Iowa</a> could in part be attributed to his support in counties with a large number of college students.</p><p>Young adults in college have been more likely to head to the polls than those who weren’t attending college, though this gap could be explained by other demographic factors. Using data from the Census Bureau&#8217;s Current Population Survey, Kawashima-Ginsberg analyzed every national election year since 2008 to show the gap in voter turnout between 18- to 24-year-olds who were and were not enrolled in college:</p><figure id="attachment_104539"class="wp-caption aligncenter "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-full wp-image-104539" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/zinshteyn-collegefreshmen-11.png?w=575" alt="zinshteyn-collegefreshmen-1" width="575" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/zinshteyn-collegefreshmen-11.png?w=575 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/zinshteyn-collegefreshmen-11.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure><p>The 2015 freshman survey also asked college students about their political leanings. Roughly one-third of first-year students view themselves as “liberal” or “far left,” and about a fifth identify as “conservative” or “far right.” That percentage of freshmen identifying as liberal or far left is the highest since 1973, when 36 percent responded that way.</p><p>The larger share of liberal-minded freshmen adds new complexity to recent data that suggests that younger voters, millennials born in the late 1980s and early 1990s, have shown slightly more conservative attitudes. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/upshot/why-teenagers-may-be-getting-more-conservative.html?_r=0">The New York Times in 2014 visualized</a> the political orientation of voters based on when they were born, with David Leonhardt wondering whether older millennials whose adult years were shaped by the recession would swing more left than their younger peers who came of age associating the recession with Obama’s presidency.</p><p>Still, scholars warn against comparing the political persuasions of young college students to the wider youth vote. One <a href="http://www.iop.harvard.edu/sites/default/files_new/pictures/151208_Harvard%20IOP%20Fall%202015%20Report.pdf">recent Harvard University poll shows</a> that 18- to 29-year-olds during Obama’s administration have been fairly uniform in their attitudes about the president (mostly supportive) regardless of whether they were in college. Like the nation at large, though, whites among 18- to 29-year-olds were much less likely to have a favorable view of Obama than blacks and Latinos in the same age group.</p><p>Even if they are eager to participate, college students can face some challenges at the voting booth. Since the 2012 presidential election, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/us/new-gop-bid-to-limit-voting-in-swing-states.html">more states have toughened their voting laws</a>, with numerous changes going into effect this year, which some advocates <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Restrictive_Appendix_Post-2010.pdf">say makes it harder</a> for students and lower-income residents to vote. How might this affect voter turnout among college kids? &#8220;Any administrative process you can add to a young person&#8217;s voting is only going to make it harder,” Kawashima-Ginsberg said, “because they’re dealing with adjustment.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104525&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carly Fiorina dropped out of the presidential race this afternoon, via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarlyFiorina/posts/10157165012225206">Facebook message</a>, a day after her <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire">seventh-place finish</a>, with just 4 percent of the vote, in the New Hampshire primary. The “<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16299.And_Then_There_Were_None">And Then There Were None</a>”-esque winnowing of the GOP presidential field continues.</p><p>Fiorina <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/us/politics/carly-fiorina-2016-presidential-bid.html">entered</a> the campaign in May of last year, the only female Republican candidate, touting her leadership experience as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard. If there was a lane for Fiorina in what was once a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/2016-presidential-candidates.html">17-lane</a> autobahn-style highway of a GOP race, then it was one for a hybrid vehicle: She was the outsider-establishment candidate, running largely on her businesswoman bona fides and having <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424419/carly-fiorina-2010-senate-campaign-conservative">never held</a> elected office, and a gender warrior to boot.</p><p>Fiorina garnered attention early in the primary season for her debate performances, particularly in response to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-insults-carly-fiorinas-appearance/">personal attacks</a> launched by Donald Trump. “Look at that face,” he said of Fiorina, according to a September <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/trump-seriously-20150909?page=13">Rolling Stone article</a>. “Would anyone vote for that?” In a Sept. 16 debate, Fiorina <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/16/politics/republican-debate-cnn-2016/">fired</a> back: “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.&#8221; Her performance was also notable for her claims about undercover videos of a Planned Parenthood clinic, which Fiorina wrongly said showed “a fully formed fetus” kicking on the table.</p><p>Not coincidentally, Fiorina’s support in the polls reached its all-time high in September:</p><figure id="attachment_104533"class="wp-caption aligncenter "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-full wp-image-104533" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/malone-fiorina-1.png?w=575" alt="malone-fiorina-1" width="575" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/malone-fiorina-1.png?w=575 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/malone-fiorina-1.png?w=1150 2x" /></figure><p>But heading into the late fall, winter and the voting contests of 2016, Fiorina had all but disappeared from the conversation. Her ground game was virtually non-existent; in Iowa, she had <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/thousands-of-ted-cruz-supporters-play-a-game-that-might-win-iowa/">no field offices</a> and only two paid staff members. Her most notable moments in the campaign remained in debates, where she took on an attack-dog <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/15/carly-fiorina-finally-says-what-she-means-about-bill-and-hillary-clintons-marriage/">role</a> against Hillary Clinton in particular.</p><p>Fiorina’s parting message for supporters contained a message directed at women in particular: “To young girls and women across the country, I say: do not let others define you. Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you&#8217;re a woman. That is not feminism. Feminism doesn&#8217;t shut down conversations or threaten women. It is not about ideology. It is not a weapon to wield against your political opponent. A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her God-given gifts. And always remember that a leader is not born, but made. Choose leadership.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104514&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Christie otherwise made very little headway in the Republican race, and he <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chris-christie-expected-formally-end-presidential-bid-early/story?id=36835186">ended his campaign</a> Wednesday after receiving just 7 percent of the vote in New Hampshire.</p><figure id="attachment_104512"class="wp-caption alignnone "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-full wp-image-104512" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-christiesout-1.png?w=575&#038;h=448" alt="silver-christiesout-1" width="575" height="448" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-christiesout-1.png?w=575&amp;h=448 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-christiesout-1.png?w=1150&amp;h=448 2x" /></figure><p>Some of this was predictable. About a year ago, I wrote an article titled “<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/chris-christie-2016-president-republican-primary-overrated/">Chris Christie’s Chances Are Overrated</a>.” The headline seems prescient now &#8212; but perhaps that analysis made the right call for the wrong reasons? So let’s quickly re-evaluate the three major faults the article claimed to find with Christie:</p><h2>Claim No. 1: Christie is too moderate</h2><p>In one basic respect, Christie’s problem was simple: He <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Chris_Christie.htm">has a relatively moderate track record</a> in a party that’s become very conservative. That was obviously a problem in Iowa, where Christie didn’t even try to compete. But even in New Hampshire, the share of Republicans who identify as moderate or liberal dropped to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/09/us/elections/new-hampshire-republican-poll.html">29 percent</a> from <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/states/new-hampshire/exit-polls">47 percent</a> four years ago. Christie had a lot of competition for this slice of the electorate, meanwhile, with Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Donald Trump (who does well with Republicans of all ideological positions) also taking their share.</p><h2>Claim No. 2: Christie probably lacks the discipline to win the “invisible primary”</h2><p>If endorsements are the best measure of insider support, then Christie’s performance was a little underwhelming. True, he placed third in FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">tally of “endorsement points”</a> at the time of his exit from the race. But Christie’s support was thinner than that score implies. Christie, the former chairman of the Republican Governors Association, won the support of three Northeastern governors, along with four House members from New Jersey, one from the Philadelphia suburbs and one from Indiana. That’s it. Basically, exactly the people you’d expect to endorse Christie endorsed him, and no one else did; he wasn’t winning the sort of “out-of-group” endorsements (say, an endorsement from a conservative Republican from the South) that are the hallmark of a consensus-building candidate.</p><p>Was this because of Christie’s lack of discipline, as I asserted in the article? That’s harder to say. Christie may have been punished by Republican elites for past sins in which he seemed disloyal to his party, especially his self-aggrandizing 2012 convention speech and his “bear hug” of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. But his 2016 operation was relatively disciplined &#8212; I would argue perhaps too disciplined, since Christie often had trouble making news.</p><h2>Claim No. 3: Christie no longer has a good “electability” case</h2><p>Usually candidates who are too moderate for the party base and too “maverick-y” for party elites make up for it by having a lot of appeal to independent voters. That’s not true for Christie, however, who <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-really-unpopular-with-general-election-voters/">has a -13 percentage point net favorability rating</a> among general election voters. Christie’s numbers <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/chris-christie-favorable-rating#!estimate=custom&amp;hiddenpollsters=morning-consult">improved slightly over the course of the campaign</a>, but not nearly enough to undo the damage wrought by “Bridgegate”; it’s easy to forget now, but Christie was once one of the most well-liked politicians in the country.</p><p>Other than in these areas, Christie has some strengths. For my money, he was the most consistent debater in the Republican field from start to finish. He’s one of the better retail politicians in the GOP field, as we saw on our recent visit to New Hampshire.</p><p>But the characteristics I mentioned before &#8212; electability and ideological alignment with and loyalty to the party &#8212; aren’t just incidental. Instead, we’ve sometimes referred to them as the “fundamentals” of presidential nominations. The eventual nominee usually scores high along each dimension, whereas Christie’s marks were middling across the board.</p><p>A deficit in these categories is hard to overcome; sheer chutzpah or tactical brilliance usually won’t do it.</p><h2>Christie also got Trumped</h2><p>Unless, maybe, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/">you’re Donald Trump</a>, who has a good shot to win the nomination despite neither being all that loyal to his party, nor all that conservative, nor all that electable. As we’ve written, Trump <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-chris-christie-should-have-taken-on-donald-trump/">represented another problem for Christie</a>. He usurped Christie’s brand as the telling-it-like-it-is candidate and as the tough-on-terrorism candidate. Trump has also won a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-boom-or-trump-bubble/">disproportionate share of media coverage throughout the campaign</a>, a problem for all of Trump’s opponents but especially Christie, a showy candidate who was once a media phenom of his own.</p><p>I suggested earlier that Christie should have run a <i>less</i> disciplined campaign, staging a few controversies to draw attention to himself. Obviously, that’s a bit tautological: It requires a lot of discipline to strategically plant a “viral moment.” But it’s remarkable how few candidates other than Trump understood that attention was the coin of the realm in a field that once had 17 candidates.</p><p>Christie also missed some obvious opportunities to take on Trump &#8212; particularly, when Trump <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/trump-carson-on-911-celebrations/">falsely</a> insinuated that “thousands and thousands” of Muslims had publicly cheered the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks from New Jersey. This was everything that Christie was supposed to be all about &#8212; 9/11, New Jersey and “telling it like it is” to <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/christie_chronicles/Christie-reaches-out-to-Muslims-calls-out-anti-Islam-bigots.html">preach tolerance of Muslims</a> &#8212; and yet, Christie <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/chris-christie-trump-911-new-jersey-216142">responded only meekly</a>, saying he didn’t recall 9/11 as Trump did.</p><p>In a nutshell, Christie was playing a long game when his fundamentals were unsound, which should have instead proposed a higher-risk, more bombastic approach. By the time his viral moment finally came in last weekend’s debate, it was too little and too late.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104506&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b>CONCORD, N.H. &#8212; When Fox News called John Kasich’s second-place finish in New Hampshire at 9 p.m. on Tuesday night, a fairly sedate cheer went up from the crowd gathered at the primary night party in a Marriott conference room here. People dressed in outdoor vests milled around drinking white wine and occasionally engaging in an “O-H-I-O” chant, but mostly politely biding time until their man from Westerville, Ohio, showed up.</p><p>Donald Trump’s night was big (he won the state with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire">35 percent</a> of the vote), but former New Hampshire Sen. John Sununu wasn’t wrong when he introduced Kasich &#8212; who finally took the stage at around 10 p.m. &#8212; as “the story coming out of New Hampshire.”</p><p>More pointedly, the story is that Kasich, flat-voweled and a little crusty, is the anti-Trump.</p><p>And not just because of the positive campaign narrative his team has been pushing, though that’s part of it: “Maybe, just maybe, we’re turning the page on a dark part of American politics,” Kasich said in his primary night speech, touting his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire">16 percent</a> support in New Hampshire. “Because tonight, the light overcame the dark.”</p><p>No, it’s also that the exit-poll numbers showed the Ohio governor finding his support in very different voter groups from the Manhattan businessman. The proof is in the numbers pudding &#8212; or the day-old King Cake, if we’re going with a seasonal metaphor.</p><p>According to an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/voted-live-hampshire-primary-exit-poll-analysis/story?id=36805930">ABC News exit poll analysis</a>, Kasich did best with those voters who wanted an experienced candidate: 45 percent of the New Hampshire electorate was looking for this rather than an outsider, and Kasich won 28 percent of them, while Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio got 20 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Trump handily won the full half of the electorate who said they wanted a political outsider, getting 57 percent of this vote, followed far behind by Ted Cruz, who took 12 percent.</p><p>Kasich’s support was grounded in well-educated voters; he got 22 percent of those with postgraduate degrees, but just 9 percent of those voters with only a high school education. Trump, meanwhile, saw his greatest backing from the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-key-to-the-gop-race-the-diploma-divide/">less-educated</a>, winning 45 percent of those with just a high school education.</p><p>And on an issue that represents a deepening existential question for the Republican Party and its vision for the country &#8212; a bigger tent or one more tightly zipped against the winds of change &#8212; Kasich and Trump supporters hold opposing views: Just a third of Republican voters said they oppose Trump’s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, but Kasich won this group with 27 percent support.</p><p>So, what’s going on here? Why did Kasich emerge as New Hampshire’s Trump-protest candidate rather than Bush, Rubio or Chris Christie? He’s more David-facing-off-against-Goliath than Republican Party elites would probably like to see at this point, but with Rubio’s poor performance in the debate preceding the primary &#8212; he finished in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire">fifth place</a> with nearly 11 percent &#8212; there was one fewer obvious establishment option for voters to choose. Bush spent quite a bit of cash in New Hampshire &#8212; <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/jeb-bush-marco-rubio-new-hampshire-219059">estimates</a> put his spending at around $16 million for the campaign and its supporting PACs &#8212; but never quite gained a critical level of interest in the state. And while Christie had his <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/For-our-safety,-our-future:-Chris-Christie-for-President">moment</a>, he had dropped precipitously in the polls by primary day. As Kasich’s national political director, Jeff Polesovsky, said of the campaign&#8217;s slow and steady door-knocking, data-gathering ground game, “We worked it &#8217;til the point that he was in people’s heads.”</p><p>With the ascendance of Trump, the Republican Party is facing a simmering anger in its electorate, and as it turns out, Kasich is connecting fairly well with those who aren’t full-on raging but are more civilly disagreeing with the state of the nation. (That’s the New England way &#8212; lots of stiff upper lips here covered in clam chowder.) Nearly half of New Hampshire GOP voters said they were dissatisfied rather than angry with the way the government was working, and while Trump won 30 percent of merely dissatisfied voters, Kasich came in next, at 21 percent.</p><p>This might have something to do with his debate showings, which have been peppery affairs. “I was a little like, &#8216;John! You’ll get your turn, don’t be screaming like that!,’” Susan Sokul of Concord said as she waited for Kasich to arrive at the primary night party. She was confident that his showing in New Hampshire would mobilize support nationally.</p><p>What remains to be seen is whether the Ohio governor can translate the success he had in New Hampshire &#8212; which has among the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/09/us/elections/new-hampshire-republican-poll.html">most moderate</a>, Kasich-friendly electorates in the country &#8212; to other states, and whether he can make the same connections he made in New Hampshire town halls with other states’ voters. Kasich was effective in these settings, if a bit<a href="http://53eig.ht/23Qa0wA"> rambling</a>. “We all need to slow down and listen to somebody else,” he had said to a Hollis crowd late last week, to heartfelt applause.</p><p>Kasich has been playing at folk philosopher for quite some time now, it’s just that last night was when people around the country started to tune in. On stage, in front of the adoring crowd at the primary night party, he seemed almost bashful in his moment of victory.</p><p>“There’s so much that’s going to happen,” he said, closing out his remarks to the on-site faithful and the late night news-watching public. “If you don’t have a seat belt, go get one.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104503&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you head out to buy roses on Feb. 14, you may find that your heart skips a beat, you have butterflies in your stomach and you feel liable to swoon. Not out of a rush of romantic feelings, but out of shock as you spot the price tag on your bouquet. On Valentine’s Day, roses are up to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rose-bouquet-pricing-variation-2014-2">twice as expensive</a> as on any other day.</p><p>Relentless optimizer that I am, I wondered if one could buy roses ahead of the price spike, hoping they’d last long enough to be presentable on Feb. 14.</p><p>After talking to florists in the 20 largest cities in the country, the answer is maybe, but you’ll have to move fast and get lucky. When I asked them to estimate the shelf life of a rose, the florists told me roses last between five and seven days.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a></p><figure id="attachment_104497"class="wp-caption alignnone "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-large wp-image-104497" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/libresco-flowers-1.png?w=575&#038;h=616" alt="libresco-flowers-1" width="575" height="616" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/libresco-flowers-1.png?w=575&amp;h=616 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/libresco-flowers-1.png?w=1150&amp;h=616 2x" /></figure><p>If you bought your roses on Feb. 10 and took good care of them,<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> you might still have a bouquet to bestow on Feb. 14. (But you’d need a good explanation for why they wilted a day or two later.)</p><p>You could eke a little more life out of the roses by keeping them in something other than tap water. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sajjad_Rahman2/publication/240624922_Evaluation_of_Commercial_Homoeopathic_and_Allopathic_Preparations_for_Their_Effect_on_Somatic_Cell_Counts_and_Milk_Composition_of_Nili-Ravi_Buffaloes/links/00463529e42ef1908c000000.pdf">In a 2005 paper</a> in the International Journal Of Agriculture &amp; Biology, Shahid Javed Butt of the Hill Fruits Research Station found that placing roses in a sucrose solution (25 grams of sugar per liter of water) extended their life for 2.5 days compared to roses in distilled water. Placing them in a silver nitrate solution (150 ppm) for 24 hours did even better, giving them an extra 3.7 days before wilting, compared to untreated flowers. That might be enough to get you through Valentine’s Day and a little while after. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KsVojEaoms">Roses will come to fear your botany powers.</a></p><p>It may be a bit easier to just pick another flower than find a cache of silver nitrate, though. I asked the florists what they’d recommend for a customer who was looking for long-lived flowers — without mentioning it was in order to buy them in advance and skip a price spike — and here’s what they suggested:</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="text" colspan="1">FLOWER</th><th class="number" colspan="1">NO. OF FLORISTS WHO RECOMMENDED</th><th class="number" colspan="1">AVG DAYS TO WILT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="text">Carnation</td><td class="number">5</td><td class="number">11</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Orchid</td><td class="number">5</td><td class="number">16</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Alstroemeria</td><td class="number">2</td><td class="number">15</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Daisy</td><td class="number">2</td><td class="number">12</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Hydrangea</td><td class="number">2</td><td class="number">23</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Bird of paradise</td><td class="number">1</td><td class="number">10</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Chrysanthemum</td><td class="number">1</td><td class="number">14</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Lily</td><td class="number">1</td><td class="number">14</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Snapdragon</td><td class="number">1</td><td class="number">7</td></tr></tbody></table><footer class="viz"><p class="notes">Average days to wilt is the average estimate given by florists who recommended that flower.</p></footer></section><p>Carnations and orchids were the most common suggestions, and the florists who recommended them estimated that they’d last about 11 and 16 days, respectively. Melissa Feveyear of the Terra Bella shop in Seattle recommended a few others, and she said you can use an easy rule of thumb to find resilient flowers: Buy tulips or blooms you frequently see in grocery stores, all of which must be “very hardy, since they don&#8217;t take much care of them.” But almost everything on the florists’ list would last if you bought it today and held on to it until the big night. Time to decide whether your partner is more partial to familiar daisies or a baroque bird-of-paradise.</p><p>When I asked the florists about their own preferences, and what flower they’d pick as the traditional Valentine’s Day bloom, a number stuck with roses, one reacted as though I’d asked her to choose between her children, and Marisa Guerrero of Debbie’s Bloomers in El Paso said she’d rather have the norm be mixed bouquets. “I wouldn&#8217;t pick one flower; it puts too much demand on the supply chain,” she told me, making her a florist after my own logistically-minded heart.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104226&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Five is the number of towns and cities Hillary Clinton won in New Hampshire. For Sanders, this is what we in the business call a &#8220;rout.&#8221; [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire">The New York Times</a>]</p><hr /><h2>6th place</h2><p>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who channeled an Atlantic City barfly and bet every dime he had on New Hampshire &#8212; but only got 6th place.

All but one of those 13 towns was won by Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

In the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump won 44 percent of those voters. On one hand, that is to be expected. On the other, <em>holy crap. </em>Fifty-six percent of people who think Muslim immigrants shouldn&#8217;t be allowed into the country supported other, ostensibly more mainstream candidates.

Bernie Sanders won among New Hampshire voters with a family income less than $30,000 per year. On the other hand, Clinton won 53 percent of the vote among families earning more than $200,000 per year. So guess what, people: We have a class war within a class war going on here!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. &#8212; Bernie Sanders won and won big here on Tuesday. He earned <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/new-hampshire">60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire</a> and won nearly every town and city in the state. The size and scope of his victory should give his campaign hope, but he still has work to do.</p><p>It would be tempting to say that Sanders won here only because of latte-drinking liberal New Englanders, but he won across ideological groups. Sanders earned the same 60 percent from <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/new-hampshire/exit/">moderate and conservative voters</a> as he did from liberal voters. If he can attract that share of moderates and conservatives in other states, he won&#8217;t hit a brick wall among whites in Appalachia or the South who <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/08DemPrimaryKeyGroups.pdf">tend to be more conservative</a> than those in New Hampshire and Iowa. Sanders may not be able to win in the Deep South, where black voters are a majority, but he can be competitive if he can win moderate whites in southern states.</p><p>The biggest dividing line in the Democratic race here was income. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 30 percentage points among voters with a family income of less than $100,000, but won by just 7 percentage points among those making more than $100,000, according to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/new-hampshire/exit/">the exit poll</a>. That divide along income lines is an advantage for Sanders: More Democrats earn below the $100,000 threshold than above it. In 2008, just 17 percent of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/08DemPrimaryKeyGroups.pdf">Democratic primary voters nationally</a> were whites from families earning more than $100,000, compared to 43 percent who were whites from families earning less than $100,000.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><em>We recorded a late-night edition of our elections podcast with some thoughts on the New Hampshire results.

A few reasons.</p><p>The most obvious is that Sanders is from Vermont, New Hampshire’s neighbor. While it would be silly to attribute Sanders&#8217;s victory here solely to neighborly kindness, he did win 70 percent or more of the vote in many places along the Vermont border. Those wins clearly helped drive up his overall margin and may have contributed to some of the trends we saw, including the split along income lines.</p><p>It&#8217;s worth remembering that Iowa Democrats are poorer than New Hampshire Democrats, and that Clinton won in Iowa. If the income breakdowns in later contests look more like they did in Iowa, then Clinton is going to be just fine. Then again, they may look like New Hampshire instead.</p><p>Even if they do, Sanders has yet to demonstrate strength in a state whose electorate isn&#8217;t more than 90 percent white. Nevada and South Carolina, the next contests, don’t look anything like Iowa or New Hampshire. Only 65 percent of voters were white in the 2008 Democratic caucus <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/NVDemHorizontal.pdf">in Nevada</a>, and only 43 percent were in <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/SCDemHorizontal.pdf">South Carolina</a>.</p><p>Polling has indicated that Sanders trails among nonwhite voters by nearly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/04/why-exactly-does-bernie-sanders-struggle-with-black-and-hispanic-voters-heres-why/">40 percentage points nationally</a>. Although no reliable recent polling is available in Nevada, Clinton leads by 30 percentage points in both of our <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/south-carolina-democratic/">South Carolina forecasts</a>. In the latest <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/SCpolls/SC160117/NBC%20News_WSJ_Marist%20Poll%20South%20Carolina%20Tables%20of%20Likely%20Democratic%20Primary%20Voters_January%202016.pdf#page=1">Marist College poll</a>, she’s buoyed by a 74 percent to 17 percent lead among black voters. Sanders must cut into that margin if he wants to have any chance in South Carolina or anywhere in the South.</p><p>You could already see how Sanders might have problems in Nevada and South Carolina even as he was crushing Clinton in New Hampshire. Despite winning the state by more than 20 percentage points, the best Sanders could manage among registered Democrats was a tie. His large margin came from registered independents who voted in the Democratic primary. You <a href="http://action.nvdems.com/page/content/caucus_faq/">must be a registered Democrat</a> to vote in the Nevada caucuses, though you can register as one the day of the election. In 2008, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/NVDemHorizontal.pdf">81 percent</a> of Nevada caucus-goers self-identified as Democrats. Just <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/new-hampshire/exit/">58 percent</a> of New Hampshire voters on Tuesday thought of themselves as Democrats.</p><p>Most worrisome for Sanders is his 25-percentage-point loss among New Hampshire Democrats who want to continue President Obama’s policies. Obama’s <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/presidential-job-approval-center.aspx">current job approval rating</a> among blacks nationally is about 90 percent. Sanders will have big problems in South Carolina if he doesn’t do better among voters who like Obama.</p><p>So the terrain ahead is friendlier for Clinton; here&#8217;s the FiveThirtyEight weighted polling average in upcoming contests (keep in mind, these averages don&#8217;t factor in any post-New Hampshire bump that Sanders might get):</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="text" colspan="1">DATE</th><th class="text" colspan="1">STATE</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">CLINTON</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">SANDERS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="text">2/20</td><td class="text">Nevada</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffb25e;">50.3</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fff5eb;">28.1</td></tr><tr><td class="text">2/27</td><td class="text">South Carolina</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ff921c;">60.5</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fff2e3;">29.3</td></tr><tr><td class="text">3/8</td><td class="text">Michigan</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ff9521;">59.9</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fff3e6;">29.0</td></tr><tr><td class="text">3/15</td><td class="text">Florida</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ff911a;">61.0</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fffbf7;">26.0</td></tr><tr><td class="text">3/15</td><td class="text">North Carolina</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffa13b;">55.9</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fff5eb;">28.3</td></tr><tr><td class="text">3/15</td><td class="text">Ohio</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffaa4d;">52.8</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffd6a8;">38.6</td></tr><tr><td class="text">4/5</td><td class="text">Wisconsin</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffc07a;">45.6</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffc78a;">43.4</td></tr><tr><td class="text">4/26</td><td class="text">Pennsylvania</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffae57;">51.4</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fff5eb;">28.0</td></tr><tr><td class="text">6/7</td><td class="text">California</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffbe78;">46.3</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffe7cc;">32.9</td></tr></tbody><caption>FiveThirtyEight polling averages as of Feb. 9</caption></table></section><p>The bottom line is that Sanders did very well in New Hampshire, and we can see the outlines of a campaign that can be competitive in the rest of the country.

If Trump’s underwhelming performance in the Iowa caucuses last week <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-comes-out-of-iowa-looking-like-pat-buchanan/">was reminiscent of Pat Buchanan</a>, his New Hampshire result put him more on par with Mitt Romney, who also finished second in Iowa four years ago before winning easily here.</p><p>No nonincumbent Republican has won both the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. But between 1980 and 2012, nine Republican candidates received at least 20 percent of the vote in each state.

The answer is probably a little bit of both. At the very least, Republicans can no longer afford to hope Trump fades out on his own &#8212; unless they’re ready for him to be their nominee.</p><p>It might seem hard to find fault with Trump&#8217;s campaign after he more than doubled his nearest rival’s vote total in New Hampshire, but allow me to nitpick a bit. Despite receiving 35 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, 50 percent of Republicans here said they’d be satisfied with Trump as their nominee, according to the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/new-hampshire/exit/">exit poll</a>.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a> Trump has converted an incredibly high percentage of his potential supporters into actual supporters, but these results (along with Trump’s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-support-in-iowa-is-narrow-but-deep/">mediocre favorability ratings</a>) suggest that he has a lower ceiling on his support than a front-runner normally does.</p><p>Trump also lacks support from GOP “<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/">party elites</a>,&#8221; with <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">no endorsements so far</a> from current Republican governors or members of Congress. That’s also highly uncharacteristic of a traditional front-runner.</p><p>But Trump&#8217;s political skills are considerably better than either Buchanan&#8217;s or Paul&#8217;s. He has the ability to <a href="http://ight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-running-a-perpetual-attention-machine/">command the national media’s attention pretty much whenever he wants to</a>, and he has improved as a debater and speaker. Furthermore, Trump’s lack of allegiance to traditional Republican policy positions allows him to adapt himself as he sees fit &#8212; a characteristic more associated with shape-shifting, coalition-building candidates like Romney than agenda-driven ones like Paul. Trump’s support also cuts relatively evenly across different demographic groups, another front-runner characteristic.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p><em>We recorded a late-night edition of our elections podcast with some thoughts on the New Hampshire results.

Instead, New Hampshire was a step backward for them. From Trump’s standpoint, in fact, the 65 percent of the GOP vote that he didn’t receive here was arranged just about as perfectly as the chandeliers at Trump Tower.</p><p>The second-place candidate, Kasich, is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html">cash-poor</a>. His 16 percent of the vote in New Hampshire was almost exactly what Jon Huntsman received four years ago, suggesting that Kasich resembles a factional candidate whose appeal is concentrated among Northeastern moderates and independents. On Tuesday, Kasich received <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/new-hampshire/exit/">28 percent of the vote among moderate voters</a>, but just 11 percent among conservatives, a group that will become much more prevalent in subsequent states. (Kasich’s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-kasichs-quiet-campaign-to-cut-abortion-access/">actual track record on issues including abortion is fairly conservative</a>, but he’ll have to reorient himself in a hurry.)</p><p>After Kasich came Ted Cruz with 12 percent of the vote &#8212; a New Hampshire performance in line with the two previous Iowa winners, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. There are <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-does-ted-cruz-go-from-here/">several reasons to think</a> that Cruz could have a higher ceiling than Huckabee or Santorum. But he’s hardly a unity candidate, and Republican elites <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/429952/ted-cruz-donald-trump-gop-establishment-prefers-trump">are at least as opposed to Cruz as they are to Trump</a>.</p><p>Following Cruz were Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, each with about 11 percent of the vote (and apparently in that order, with Bush in fourth place and Rubio in fifth). Until about 96 hours ago, Rubio looked like Republicans’ best chance to stop Trump. But the momentum he gained after a third-place finish in Iowa evaporated, presumably in part because of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-thought-marco-rubio-lost-the-debate-but-new-hampshire-might-think-differently/">his poor performance in Saturday’s debate</a> and the media freakout that followed.</p><p>It <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/new-hampshire-primary-presidential-election-2016/?#livepress-update-22138092">strains credulity</a> to suggest that Bush has much momentum of his own, though, after he and his super PAC spent almost $90 million to get 3 percent of the vote in Iowa and 11 percent in New Hampshire. Bush is a known commodity who has arguably already been put forward and rejected by Republican voters, with underwhelming <a href="http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/188177/trump-image-among-democrats-independents-negative-gop-candidate.aspx">favorability ratings</a>.</p><p>If you could somehow combine Rubio’s likability and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marco-rubio-the-electable-conservative/">appeal to conservatives</a>, Kasich’s policy smarts and post-New Hampshire momentum, and Bush’s war chest and organization, you’d have a pretty good candidate on your hands. But instead, these candidates are likely to spend the next several weeks sniping at one another. The circular firing squad mentality was already apparent in New Hampshire, where fewer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/08/us/politics/republican-presidential-candidates-attacks-new-hampshire.html">advertising dollars were directed against Trump</a> despite his having led <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/#polls-only">all but one poll of the state</a> since July. Trump has also been attacked less than Rubio and Cruz in recent debates.</p><p>The Republican field probably will consolidate, eventually. In about the only bad piece of news for Trump on Tuesday, it appears possible that Chris Christie will soon end his campaign. And it might not take that much to upend the stalemate between Rubio, Kasich and Bush. I’m guessing, for example, that if Rubio and Kasich had switched places on Tuesday, the national media conversation would be about how Rubio’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/429980/marco-rubios-south-carolina-strategy">“3-2-1” plan</a> was right on track and how it was time for Kasich and Bush to fold up shop. It might seem fanciful to swap the second-place and fifth-place candidates, but only about 15,000 votes separated Kasich from Rubio in New Hampshire.</p><p>By the time that consolidation happens, however, Trump and Cruz will have swept up quite a few delegates. And whichever Republican emerges from the “establishment” pack isn’t necessarily a favorite to beat Trump one-on-one (or Trump and Cruz in a three-way race). A lot of Republicans would never consider voting for Bush, in particular.</p><p>It would be easy enough to overreact to Tuesday’s results. With only two states having voted so far, we don’t really have enough data to know why Trump finished with 24 percent of the vote in one of them but 35 percent in the other, or which result represents the better baseline going forward. (Be wary of tautological explanations along the lines of “Iowa was a bad state for Trump” or “New Hampshire was a good state for Trump.”) <a href="http://predictwise.com/">Prediction markets</a> regard Trump as more likely than any other candidate to win the Republican nomination but nevertheless slightly worse than even money against the field, an assessment that strikes me as pretty reasonable.</p><p>But for anti-Trump Republicans, there’s a danger to underreaction, too. One reason that candidates like Trump have <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-six-stages-of-doom/">rarely won nominations</a> in the past is because parties take a lot of steps to fight them. If the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-republicans-really-are-in-disarray/">Republican Party’s defense mechanisms are broken</a>, or if it assumes Trump will go away without intervention, the rest of the party may be competing for second place.</p><p><em>Check out the latest <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/?ex_cid=endlink">forecasts for the 2016 presidential primaries</a>.</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104452&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the final set of interviews with amateur Oscar modelers in our series on how to <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/predict-the-oscars/">predict the Oscars</a>! So far, we&#8217;ve talked to people trying to pick the winners by looking at data on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-internet-predict-the-oscars/">what people are talking about on Twitter and Google News</a>, folks who use a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-we-need-to-know-to-predict-the-oscars/">big model with lots of variables and a simple model that uses only one or two</a>, and contenders who <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-fake-the-academy-to-predict-the-oscars/">are trying to simulate the Academy</a>.</p><p>Today, we’re looking at two models that try to analyze film reviews and the press to find movies that could win the Oscar. One looks at reviews to figure out words that have indicated past Oscar winners. The second analyzes a set of publications read by people in Hollywood to determine what those readers might care about and then uses text analysis of movie reviews to find which nominees hew closest to the Academy’s worldview.</p><p>But first, another update on the FiveThirtyEight Oscar race tracker.</p><h2>An update to our Oscar predictions</h2><p>The Directors Guild awards were handed out over the weekend, and a win by Alejandro González Iñárritu has put the best picture Oscar race in flux. Iñárritu directed “Leonardo DiCaprio Got A New Fur Coat But, Gosh, Was It Worth The Consequences?” &#8212; released domestically as “The Revenant.” For now, that film is the favorite to win the best picture Oscar, but “The Big Short” and “Spotlight” are hot on its heels. In the race for the best directing Oscar, Iñárritu has leaped over George Miller (“Mad Max: Fury Road”) to take the lead and based on the math will remain the front-runner until the Oscars.</p><div class="promo"><p class="image"><a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/oscars-2016/"><img class="pullout" sizes="(min-width: 440px) 153px, 100vw" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/oscars_art_animation_slow.gif?w=153&amp;quality=100&amp;strip=all 153w, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/oscars_art_animation_slow.gif?w=306&amp;quality=100&amp;strip=all 306w, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/oscars_art_animation_slow.gif?w=405&amp;quality=100&amp;strip=all 405w, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/oscars_art_animation_slow.gif?w=810&amp;quality=100&amp;strip=all 810w" alt="Montage of Oscar candidates" width="153" height="115" /></a></p><p class="text"><strong>Interactive:</strong>Our elections-style Oscar model looks at the predictive power of film awards over the past 25 years and tracks this year’s nominees and winners to try to gauge the race in the big six Academy Award categories. <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/oscars-2016/">See the state of the Oscars race »</a></p></div><p>The next award show to look forward to is the BAFTAs, which takes place this weekend &#8212; the awards from the British Academy are the last highly predictive event that we track. A win for “The Big Short” or “Spotlight” there would put either of those films neck and neck with “The Revenant,” but a win for the front-runner would push it definitively ahead of the pack. Also, keep an eye on the best supporting actor category to see if there’s a chance for a challenge to Sylvester Stallone (“Creed”).</p><p>Now on to our modelers. (These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.)</p><h2>The reviews-based model</h2><figure id="attachment_104205"class="wp-caption alignright "style="max-width: 150px"><img class="wp-image-104205" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/allison_walker_picture.jpg?w=300&#038;h=150" alt="Allison_Walker_picture" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/allison_walker_picture.jpg?w=300&amp;h=150 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/allison_walker_picture.jpg?w=600&amp;h=150 2x" /></figure><p>Allison Walker is a Yale chemist who thinks she can judge the Oscar race by reading movie reviews and looking for patterns in the words used to describe past Oscar winners. Although she acknowledges that her method is probably not as predictive as an approach like ours that looks directly at past winners, she’s hoping to develop a great supplemental model.</p><p><b>Walt Hickey:</b> Tell me a little bit about yourself!</p><p><b>Allison Walker: </b>I study mostly biochemistry problems. The two things I’m working on right now for my Ph.D. are trying to figure out the application of this dye that labels proteins and using a statistical technique developed by this lab in Texas to study long-range interactions in the ribosome, which is the machine that synthesizes all proteins in the cell. The ultimate goal is to engineer the ribosome to make new types of molecules.</p><p>The lab that I work in doesn&#8217;t do that much computational or statistical work, but my adviser has been really supportive of me bringing statistical techniques to the lab.</p><p><b>WH:</b> What attracted you to predicting the Oscars?</p><p><b>AW:</b> I don’t have that much interest in the Oscars movies. But I saw <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/predicting-the-oscars-is-hard-do-you-have-the-solution/">the article</a> [asking for Oscar prediction model submissions], and I had just taken a machine-learning class. I thought it would be a cool problem.</p><p><b>WH: </b>How would you describe your approach?</p><p><b>AW:</b> The general idea is to use word counts of different words in reviews, with common words taken out [like “the,” “for” and “and”], to see if there’s any association between certain words and winning. The math behind it isn’t all that important, but it looks at which words are more associated with winning and losing; if you take the word counts in reviews for a given movie, you can assign a probability that the movie will be a winner.</p><p><b>WH: </b>What about best actor and best actress?</p><p><b>AW:</b> What I’m going to do is break down the reviews by sentences and only count words used in the same sentence as the actor’s name or their character’s. This could be a problem for movies where the movie’s name is the same as the character’s name, because there’s no way to tell if the sentence is referring to the movie or the character.</p><p><b>WH: </b>What are your hopes for the model?</p><p><b>AW: </b>For best picture and directing, it’s better than guessing but not actually great. I would like to see it go above 50 percent accuracy to something closer to 70 percent or 80 percent, but I’m not sure if that’s possible!</p><h3>INITIAL PREDICTIONS</h3><p>Allison has “The Revenant” in the lead for best picture, with “Mad Max: Fury Road” a distant second. She said her model&#8217;s best picture predictions have 71.4 percent historical accuracy. For best director, she’s picking Miller to start, with Iñárritu a far second. In the best actor and best actress categories, she’s picking DiCaprio and Brie Larson (“Room”).</p><p>In the best supporting actor category &#8212; probably the toughest to call this year, other than best picture &#8212; Allison’s model has Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies”) in the lead. Her model also found a strong showing for Tom Hardy (“The Revenant”), but Allison believes that may be because a lot of reviewers are discussing Hardy and DiCaprio in the same sentence. Kate Winslet (“Steve Jobs”) leads in the best supporting actress category, with Alicia Vikander (“The Danish Girl”) close behind.</p><h2>The worldview simulator</h2><p>Gary Angel of Ernst and Young has assembled a team of folks to try to crack the Oscars. The gist: Use data to find out what the people who vote on the Oscars care about by analyzing what appears in the Hollywood press — in this case, one year of Vanity Fair and the Los Angeles Times culture and opinion sections <b>—</b> and then do a text analysis of movie reviews to find the nominated films that appeal to that worldview. For example, if back in 2013 there were lots of stories about “Iran” or “rescues” or “heists” in the press, then “Argo” might be favored to win because the same themes would appear in reviews of the film. For the acting categories, Gary’s team applies the same methodology to reviews of the performances.</p><p><b>Walt Hickey: </b>Tell me about your squad.</p><p><b>Gary Angel: </b>We are the digital analytics/advanced analytics team at Ernst &amp; Young. We handle a lot of analytics related to understanding how people behave. That covers everything from website behavior to mobile and social behaviors; we do a lot of work understanding who people are, why they do what they’re doing, and how people can optimize their experiences.</p><p><b>WH</b>: Who else is working on your Oscar model?</p><p><b>GA: </b>I’m leading what we call a counseling family &#8212; it’s a large group of people, all of them are analysts, a lot of them are West Coast-based. We get together socially, sometimes to go over business stuff, sometimes to do shared projects together. This seemed like something my team would enjoy &#8212; we all love getting our hands on the data and doing this kind of stuff.</p><p>Not everybody has time for this, but I think we’re going to have eight different people spending at least a little bit of time on the project. We’re going to have the whole team at least brainstorm parts of the model.</p><p><b>WH: </b>What’s the approach?</p><p><b>GA: </b>I have to admit <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-guide-to-predicting-the-oscars/">the approach you guys take</a> when it comes to building the core predictive model is probably going to beat out anything we’re likely to do with this, but I was really thinking about alternative approaches that might supplement that model.</p><p>It sort of seemed to us that when you have a small set of movies, all of which presumably are pretty high-quality, you’re going to have a set of concerns that are political and personal that are going to drive a lot of [the Academy&#8217;s] voting. But that stuff is really hard to get at. It seemed like sometimes movies get picked because they fit a certain kind of worldview. They fit what people are thinking about right now, either the topical interest or just the way the Hollywood community is thinking about the world.</p><p><b>WH: </b>How would you explain the core of your model?</p><p><b>GA:</b> First of all, we have to find a corpus that adequately represents the Hollywood worldview, because that’s what we’re matching to. That’s an interesting problem in and of itself: We don’t know the exact sample [of Academy voters], we don’t know who’s behind the voting. We’re going to have to pick something we think is reasonably reflective.</p><p>The second thing is how do you capture a worldview? Once we’ve got this corpus, what we’re going to see is that they talk about things in different ways. Some topics emerge very strongly, some don’t emerge that would in the broader press. What we’ll probably do is take these initial corpuses and do some initial analysis about sentiment, topicality, what kind of language is being used.</p><p>The hope is what we’re eventually going to do is something like a cluster analysis. We’re going to take all these cultural dimensions, we’re going to group the movies, and we’re going to group them against how the Hollywood community falls out on that and see what’s closest. The essence of the model is saying, “Can we take some movie and match it up to a community and say it fits fairly well with their worldview?” Maybe it leads to some additional predictive value, but it also just seems like something inherently interesting to know.</p><p><b>WH: </b>So to figure out how a film would be received among a group of people, you’re going to analyze what they read to figure out a “worldview,” then you’re going to find out what is said about the film [in reviews], and then you’re going figure out which film is most similar to the worldview.</p><p><b>GA: </b>That’s it! That’s the core of the process. And I laugh a little bit, because it’s highly speculative, obviously. We’re not sure how this is going to work at all. We do a fair amount of traditional language processing and social media culling, but this certainly pushes the boundaries.</p><p><b>WH:</b> We love the models that are like, “We have no idea if this will work, but it’s cool to think about.&#8221;</p><p><b>GA: </b>We fall into that group, yes.</p><h3>INITIAL PREDICTIONS</h3><p>Based on the model, Gary’s team thinks “The Big Short” is the best cultural fit for the current mood in Hollywood, followed by “Spotlight” and “Brooklyn.” The team is still working on refining its predictions for the acting awards: Considering that Bryan Cranston (“Trumbo&#8221;) and Jennifer Lawrence (“Joy&#8221;) are in the lead, Gary said, the team is probably “going down in flames on this one” if it can’t tweak the model.</p><p><b>More Predict The Oscars:</b></p><p><a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/oscars-2016/">The 2016 Oscars Race</a></p><p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-we-need-to-know-to-predict-the-oscars/">How Much Do We Need To Know To Predict The Oscars?</a></p><p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-internet-predict-the-oscars/">Can The Internet Predict The Oscars?</a></p><p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-guide-to-predicting-the-oscars/">FiveThirtyEight’s Guide To Predicting The Oscars</a></p><p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-fake-the-academy-to-predict-the-oscars/">Can You Fake The Academy To Predict The Oscars?</a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104124&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. &#8212; Before the Iowa Republican caucuses last week, we <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/iowa-is-the-hardest-state-to-poll/">warned you</a> that the uncertainty in the race was high and that the polls might be way off. That’s even more true here in New Hampshire.</p><p>At least we know that <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-will-probably-win-new-hampshire/">Donald Trump will finish first</a> on the Republican side? Well, probably. Trump has led all but one poll here since July; his numbers have slumped by a couple of percentage points since his second-place finish in Iowa, but nobody has come especially close to him. And yet, because the uncertainty is so great in New Hampshire, Trump’s victory is not quite assured: Our <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/">polls-plus forecast</a> still gives Trump a 31 percent chance of somehow losing here.</p><p>The reason for this is that, historically, the more viable<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> candidates there are in a state, the more error-prone the polling has tended to be. Multi-candidate races open up the possibility of last-minute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting">tactical voting</a> and otherwise give voters plenty of options, making them more likely to change their minds at the last minute. Our forecast models account for this dynamic, which is why Trump’s lead is <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-democratic/#polls-only">much less safe than Bernie Sanders’s in the two-way race on the Democratic side</a>, even though both candidates lead their nearest competitor by about the same 15-percentage-point margin in the polling average. (I think the model might be a little bit <i>too</i> confident about Sanders &#8212; I’d personally put his odds at more like 95 percent rather than 99 percent &#8212; but we’ll save that discussion for later.)</p><p>So let’s look at New Hampshire from the standpoint of the six leading Republican candidates. For each one, I’ve listed their 90th percentile and 10th percentile forecasts from our <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-are-forecasting-the-2016-presidential-primary-election/">polls-plus model</a> to show the most likely range of possible outcomes.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a></p><h2>Donald Trump</h2><p><b>90th percentile forecast: </b>39 percent</p><p><b>10th percentile forecast: </b>17 percent</p><p>We’ve somehow reverted back to the pattern before Iowa, where the other Republicans <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-gop-establishment-blowing-its-anti-trump-campaign/">weren’t spending much time attacking Trump</a> despite his lead in the polls. In Iowa, voters took matters into their own hands and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-comes-out-of-iowa-looking-like-pat-buchanan/">turned away from Trump at the last minute</a>. Could the same thing happen here?</p><p>It’s entirely possible; the polls-plus model projects Trump to finish with 27 percent of the vote &#8212; a little less than the 30 percent he has in the polling average. But there’s a huge amount of uncertainty around that estimate. Suppose, for instance, that Trump finishes with a vote share in the mid-to-high 30s. Such a performance would erase many of our doubts about Trump’s ceiling and make him look formidable in South Carolina and beyond.</p><p>Conversely, if Trump won but with more like the 27 percent of the vote that Pat Buchanan got in New Hampshire in 1996, he’d look more like a factional candidate who was benefiting from the divided field. And if Trump’s vote share falls into the low 20s or even the high teens, meanwhile, he would be vulnerable to losing New Hampshire outright. It would also raise a lot of questions about whether the polls were oversampling Trump voters.</p><h2>Marco Rubio</h2><p><b>90th percentile forecast: </b>25 percent</p><p><b>10th percentile forecast: </b>9 percent</p><p>The polls-plus forecast still has Rubio in second place, but that’s deceptive. He’s only a fraction of a percentage point ahead of John Kasich, with Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz lurking almost as close. In fact, the polls-plus forecast has Rubio with a 64 percent chance of finishing third or worse and he could <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marco-rubio-is-in-a-precarious-spot-in-new-hampshire/">easily enough slip to fifth or sixth</a>. Here’s our final matrix of probabilities for Rubio and the other candidates:</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="text" colspan="1">CANDIDATE</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">FIRST</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">SECOND</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">THIRD</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">FOURTH</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">FIFTH</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">SIXTH+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="text">Donald Trump</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffab4f;">69%</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffe8cf;">19%</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fff6ed;">7%</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fffbf7;">3%</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fffefc;">1%</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1%</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Marco Rubio</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff2e3;">11</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe1bf;">25</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe3c4;">23</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe8cf;">19</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffefde;">13</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff4e8;">9</td></tr><tr><td class="text">John Kasich</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff3e6;">10</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe2c2;">24</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe3c4;">23</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe8cf;">19</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffeedb;">14</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff2e3;">11</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Jeb Bush</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff8f0;">6</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffebd6;">16</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe7cc;">20</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe4c7;">22</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe8cf;">19</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffead4;">17</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Ted Cruz</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffaf5;">4</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffefde;">13</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffead4;">17</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe4c7;">22</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe4c7;">22</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe3c4;">23</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Chris Christie</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffdfa;">2</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff9f2;">5</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff3e6;">10</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffe9d1;">18</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ffb15c;">64</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Carly Fiorina</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffbf7;">3</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff9f2;">5</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fff2e3;">11</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ff9d33;">80</td></tr><tr><td class="text">Ben Carson</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffefc;">&lt;1</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#fffbf7;">3</td><td class="heat number" style="padding-right:1.1em;background-color:#ff8a0a;">96</td></tr></tbody><caption>Chance of finishing in each position, N.H.

At the same time, pundits are <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-thought-marco-rubio-lost-the-debate-but-new-hampshire-might-think-differently/">often pretty bad</a> at anticipating how voters will react to debates and other gaffes. Ultimately, the impact of the debate will be hard to measure: Rubio could wind up with 18 percent of the vote despite the debate, but would have gotten 22 percent without it.</p><p>No matter what happens, the media reaction to Rubio’s finish tonight is likely to be hyperbolic. If he gets (say) 22 percent of the vote, or only 8 percent, a strong reaction might be warranted. But you may also see reporters parsing relatively small differences, like between 16 percent and 13 percent. Mostly, you should ignore them, because there are two more important things to watch in the aftermath of New Hampshire. The first, as FiveThirtyEight contributor Julia Azari <a href="http://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2016/2/8/10938056/rubio-glitch-gaffe">writes</a>, is how Republican Party leaders react to Rubio’s performance. Is he continuing to get <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">endorsements</a>? How are people who actually have influence within the Republican Party &#8212; not just TV talking heads &#8212; spinning his performance? If Rubio finishes narrowly ahead of Bush, are there calls for Bush to drop out? The second thing to watch: How does Rubio perform in this Saturday’s debate in South Carolina.</p><h2>John Kasich</h2><p><b>90th percentile forecast: </b>24 percent</p><p><b>10th percentile forecast: </b>8 percent</p><p>As I said on our <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/elections-podcast-new-hampshires-turn/">podcast</a>, I suppose I’ll be “that guy” who thinks Kasich has some potential to outperform his polls. As measured by his <a href="https://twitter.com/PollsterPatrick/status/696779989371461632">number of voter contacts</a> (as well as our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBiT4BDHNHV/">own observations</a>), he has one of the best ground games in New Hampshire. Also &#8212; this was a favorable indicator for Cruz and Rubio before Iowa &#8212; he’s seen a late, Election Day <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F0cqt90%2C%20%2Fm%2F07j6ty%2C%20%2Fm%2F0dpr5f%2C%20%2Fm%2F02zzm_%2C%20%2Fm%2F019x9z&amp;geo=US-NH&amp;date=now%201-d&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5">spike in Google search traffic</a>. The polls-plus model also has Kasich beating his polls by a couple of percentage points, for what it’s worth. We’ll know soon enough.</p><p>The question is how Kasich would take advantage of a strong finish. He has run pretty far to the left in New Hampshire despite having a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-kasich-a-jeb-bush-in-jon-huntsman-clothing/">fairly conservative record as governor of Ohio</a>. That moderation really does help him here, but there are fewer centrist Republicans outside New Hampshire. Furthermore, Kasich <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html">doesn’t have all that much money remaining</a>, certainly not as compared with candidates like Bush.</p><p>My guess is that there’s a difference between Kasich doing pretty well and doing <i>really</i> well. If Kasich replicates Jon Huntsman’s 17 percent of the vote from four years ago, he might be a good story for a few days but not have much impact beyond that. If he gets to 20 percent or more of the vote, however, finishing well ahead of the other “establishment lane” candidates and even threatening to win here, that’s a different story.</p><h2>Jeb Bush</h2><p><b>90th percentile forecast: </b>22 percent</p><p><b>10th percentile forecast: </b>7 percent</p><p>Bush is only barely behind Kasich in the New Hampshire polls, and has some advantages Kasich does not: more money, more organization and more support from party elites. That could leave Bush better poised than Kasich to take advantage of a strong finish here.</p><p>He also has one big problem, however: Bush is much more of a known commodity among Republican voters, and he’s not very well-liked, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/188177/trump-image-among-democrats-independents-negative-gop-candidate.aspx">with favorability ratings barely better than breakeven within his own party</a>. So one possibility is that Bush has a strong performance in New Hampshire and eventually, after some further reshuffling, becomes the “establishment lane” finalist after all &#8212; only to lose to Trump or Cruz.</p><h2>Ted Cruz</h2><p><b>90th percentile forecast: </b>20 percent</p><p><b>10th percentile forecast: </b>6 percent</p><p>Cruz, who <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marco-rubio-stole-ted-cruzs-iowa-bounce/">didn’t get much of a bounce after Iowa</a>, probably has the least on the line in New Hampshire. If he does well here, that will be a sign that his turnout operation is effective at identifying evangelical and “movement conservative” voters even in a state that has relatively few of them. It might also mean he’s picked up some support from Rand Paul, who was reasonably popular here and dropped out of the race after Iowa.</p><p>But Cruz should mostly be focused on South Carolina and the March 1 primaries, where he’ll need to rack up a lot of delegates to make up for a calendar that will <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/beware-a-gop-calendar-front-loaded-with-states-friendly-to-trump-and-cruz/">turn worse for him</a> as the election wears on. Both Cruz and Trump would benefit from an ambiguous outcome in which at least three of Rubio, Kasich, Bush and Christie continue to run for some time after New Hampshire.</p><h2>Chris Christie</h2><p><b>90th percentile forecast: </b>13 percent</p><p><b>10th percentile forecast: </b>3 percent</p><p>I’ve been a little surprised that Christie, who has been excellent in debates and in the retail settings where we’ve seen him here in New Hampshire, is stuck at just 6 percent in the polls. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/696852358421200896">mentioned this</a> on Twitter yesterday, there were a bunch of theories: Bridgegate, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+christie+hug&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-t_LwmevKAhUDaz4KHcCmBmIQ_AUICSgD&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=718">The Hug</a>, and even Christie’s being a <a href="http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2015/10/chris_christie_is_wearing_mets_cufflinks_during_re.html">New York Mets</a> fan. I get all that, and we were <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/chris-christie-2016-president-republican-primary-overrated/">pretty skeptical about Christie’s chances</a> a year or so ago when other people were more bullish on them. But we’re not talking about Christie winning the nomination; we’re talking about him failing to poll in the double-digits in a state that should be pretty good for him.</p><p>Still, there’s some chance Christie could overperform his projection, especially if the Republican debate is not fully priced into the polls. The polls-plus model gives Christie a 7 percent chance of finishing in the top three, an outcome that would have the benefit of being unexpected and would therefore get him a lot of buzz. And if Christie finishes ahead of Rubio, the media buzzards will be circling Rubio’s campaign.</p><p><strong><em>Check our our <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/new-hampshire-primary-presidential-election-2016/">live coverage and results from the New Hampshire Primary elections.</a></em></strong></p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-104187-5" preload="none" style="width: 100%; visibility: hidden;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3?_=5" /><a href="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3">http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3</a></audio><p><em>The FiveThirtyEight <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/elections-podcast/">elections podcast</a> team is in New Hampshire ahead of that state’s primary.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a lot of angles, Peyton Manning is the <a href="http://www.footballperspective.com/the-greatest-qb-of-all-time-v-part-ii-career-rankings/">greatest quarterback of all time</a>. His second Super Bowl win, however, came in decidedly <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/peyton-manning-had-the-worst-season-of-any-super-bowl-quarterback-ever/">un-Peyton-like fashion</a>, with Manning riding in the wake of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cam-newton-never-had-a-chance/">an all-time defense</a> while doddering well below replacement level for most of the season. Perhaps this is karma, a just reward after a career of — with a few exceptions — being shackled to some of the worst defenses ever to run deep into the playoffs. It&#8217;s the popular line of thinking, at least, and popular enough to dig a little deeper. So: Just how bad <i>were</i> Peyton&#8217;s defenses in his best years?</p><p>Here&#8217;s a look at the statistical profiles of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/">Hall of Fame</a> and near-Hall of Fame QBs from the modern era — this includes the defensive and rushing support each received throughout his career, but especially his prime. To find this, I took each passer&#8217;s performance in a few categories — completion percentage, yards per completion, touchdown percentage, interception percentage, sack percentage — and sorted them by their percentile relative to the league in any given season. I then weighted each season to give more weight to a player&#8217;s best years according to <a href="http://www.footballperspective.com/are-the-super-bowl-winning-qbs-getting-worse/">value over replacement</a> (<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/griffey-in-his-prime-was-the-second-coming-of-willie-mays/">like I did with Ken Griffey Jr. here</a>). Then, I did the same for Defense-adjusted Value Over Average for both rushing offense and defense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="upper" style="border-right-width:10px;border-right-style:solid;border-right-color:#ffffff;" colspan="1"></th><th class="upper upper-text" style="border-right-width:10px;border-right-style:solid;border-right-color:#ffffff;" colspan="5">PERCENTILE VS.

breaking down the characteristics of Manning and his teams over the years, it’s amazing to see how sharply the usual tendencies were inverted along Denver’s path to the championship. On average, Manning’s teams were middle-of-the-pack on defense, and a shade better than that at running the ball. That was more than enough to rattle off an absurd string of 10-plus-win seasons, because Manning was very good — if not completely and totally great — in every facet of passing the football. His average defense was worse than that supporting Brett Favre, Joe Montana or Steve Young, and the running game was less efficient than what Tom Brady, Drew Brees or John Elway was working with.</p><p>Manning did have a lot more help than Dan Marino, but he also bested him across every passing category — like a more accurate, deeper-throwing version of the Dolphins great, who got the ball out just as fast but was more careful with it. And since we&#8217;re looking at percentiles instead of raw output, the differences between eras soften, though they don&#8217;t completely disappear.</p><p>That was prime Peyton, however. <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/peyton-manning-had-the-worst-season-of-any-super-bowl-quarterback-ever/">This year’s version was far, far worse</a>, particularly in categories where he once excelled. To wit: His rates of completions, touchdowns and interceptions, each typically among the top 30 percent of regular QBs, all dipped into the bottom quarter of passers this season. Meanwhile, his defensive support, usually in the middle of the pack, zoomed up to the best in football.</p><figure id="attachment_104184"class="wp-caption alignnone "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-full wp-image-104184" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/paine-peytonsteams-1.png?w=575&#038;h=471" alt="paine-peytonsteams-1" width="575" height="471" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/paine-peytonsteams-1.png?w=575&amp;h=471 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/paine-peytonsteams-1.png?w=1150&amp;h=471 2x" /></figure><p>It’s been a stunning reversal, the likes of which we haven’t really seen from such a good QB before; the only possible exceptions were the final full seasons of Marino, Ken Stabler and Joe Theismann’s careers. Those performances all came in the service of mediocre teams, though. Somehow Manning actually turned an even more extreme version of this formula into a championship.</p><p>We <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Paine/status/696548427119788032">aren&#8217;t sure</a> if the Super Bowl was Manning’s final game, and it&#8217;s hard to speculate about how this changes Manning’s legacy (not that a paltry two titles will ever satiate the “Count The Ringz!!!” crowd anyway). But even if Manning happened to be dragged to a championship in the final throes of his senescence by Von Miller and Denver’s ferocious defense, it’s hard not to appreciate the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/super-bowl-50-panthers-vs-broncos/?lpup=19931691#livepress-update-19931691">strange symmetry</a> after Manning spent a career elevating middling <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/clt/2011.htm">and worse</a> teams with his brilliance.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104178&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Hampshire: the land of pot roast, fleece-lined jeans and independent-minded voters. Truisms about freethinking New England voters are trotted out every primary year thanks to New Hampshire’s system, which<a href="http://sos.nh.gov/VotePartyPrimFAQ.aspx"> allows</a> unaffiliated voters to participate in either party’s primary so long as they register at the door. (And they can make sure their voting status reverts to independent on the way out — they’ve thought of everything, these Yankees.)</p><p>This year’s horse race will place the indie vote on no stumpier a pedestal than usual, though perhaps more idiosyncratically, the most pitched battle on the GOP side is over who will place or show, not necessarily who will win. (Bernie Sanders is a heavy favorite over Hillary Clinton in the two-person Democratic race.) The soon-to-be-gold-plated Republican laurels will <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-will-probably-win-new-hampshire/">likely be going to Donald Trump</a>, who’s a 75 percent favorite according to our <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/#polls-only">polls-only forecast</a>. Marco Rubio and John Kasich are the current second- and third-placers, respectively, according to our weighted polling average, but after Saturday’s debate, it’s clear the sharpest elbows being thrown are by the middle-of-the-pack “establishment” guys looking to scar the front-runners and scramble their way up the leader ladder. Chris Christie seemed like he’d swallowed salt and fire pre-debate and was more than happy to spit them repeatedly at Rubio.</p><p>So how does one break out of the middling scrum? Getting New Hampshire’s independent voters to like you? That sure doesn’t hurt, especially since those indies, while prideful of their the-cheese-stands-alone-ness, actually <i>do </i>lean one way or the other, and this year they seem more interested in the Republican race. A <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2016/02/Topline-WBUR-NH-Primary-7.pdf">survey</a> of New Hampshire voters conducted last week by WBUR and the Mass Inc. Polling group showed that 46 percent of independent respondents were planning on voting in the Republican primary, and 40 percent were planning on voting in the Democratic one.</p><p>How significant have independent voters been in past elections? In <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/states/new-hampshire/exit-polls">2012</a>, self-identified independent voters made up 47 percent of GOP primary voters, and 31 percent of them turned out to love Ron Paul, with Mitt Romney following closely in their affections (Romney won overall, Paul came in second). For a more 30,000-feet-up view of the New Hampshire electorate that year, 38 percent were registered as undeclared, 33 percent were Republicans and 29 percent were Democrats according to data gathered by University of New Hampshire political scientists David W. Moore and Andrew E. Smith in their bodice ripper “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-First-Primary-Presidential-Nominations/dp/1611687985">The First Primary: New Hampshire’s Outsize Role in Presidential Nominations</a>.”</p><p>In 2008, independents (or “undeclared” voters, as they are more properly known) were<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/NHRepHorizontal.pdf"> 34 percent</a> of the GOP primary electorate, and 38 percent of them went for John McCain; on the Democratic side,<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/PollingUnit/NHDemHorizontal.pdf"> 42 percent</a> of the voters were independents, and 40 percent of them voted for Barack Obama. But it’s important to note that 62 percent of all independents voted in the Democratic race rather than the Republican one. That’s because while New Hampshire independents talk a good game about their maverick thinking, most tend to vote with one party or the other. According to polling data collected from 1999 to 2014 by Moore and Smith, about 40 percent consistently vote Republican, 45 percent Democratic and only 15 percent are truly independents. So, it makes sense that in the last race without an incumbent, more independents wanted to have their say in the Democratic primary.</p><p>But what about this year’s race? It has already geared up the story line about independents, with various darlings playing the lead at various points: Kasich and Christie have alternated star and understudy for the past couple of months in the media narrative. As of early February, though, according to <a href="https://www.wbur.org/2016/02/05/final-wbur-poll-new-hampshire">WBUR/Mass Inc. Polling’s projected scenarios</a>, the more undeclared New Hampshirites who vote in the GOP primary, the better Kasich will do:</p><p><a href="https://www.wbur.org/2016/02/05/final-wbur-poll-new-hampshire" rel="attachment wp-att-104133"><img class="size-large wp-image-104133" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/wbur_ind_gop.png?w=575&#038;h=312" alt="wbur_ind_gop" width="575" height="312" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/wbur_ind_gop.png?w=575&amp;h=312 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/wbur_ind_gop.png?w=1150&amp;h=312 2x" /></a></p><p>And the Democrats?

When I talked to Moore, he was more than eager to dispel the myth of the independent voter in New Hampshire altogether. “True independents tend not to turn out,” he said. “Independents are not going to be a significant factor.” He went on to point out that no outsider candidate — someone you think those undeclared voters would spring for — has won the primary without also winning a plurality of registered party voters.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-104127-6" preload="none" style="width: 100%; visibility: hidden;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3?_=6" /><a href="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3">http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3</a></audio><p><em>The FiveThirtyEight <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/elections-podcast/">elections podcast</a> team is in New Hampshire ahead of that state’s primary.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump more likely than not will win the New Hampshire primary today. Both <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/#polls-only">FiveThirtyEight forecasts</a> give him more than a 2-in-3 shot to finish first. So let’s take a moment to appreciate what’s about to happen. Sure, Trump has some <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-comes-out-of-iowa-looking-like-pat-buchanan/">rough precedents</a>, like Pat Buchanan, but the fact that he will probably win the first primary is … noteworthy.</p><p>But Trump still has a long-term problem: Our forecast projects him to receive a little less than 30 percent of the vote in New Hampshire. That might be enough to win &#8212; but mostly because the field is so big and the non-Trump vote so divided. So far at least, Trump has had a ceiling on his support. And there are signs of this ceiling in upcoming primaries in the South, which was supposed to be one of his strongest regions.</p><p>Trump has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/upshot/donald-trumps-strongest-supporters-a-certain-kind-of-democrat.html">historically done well</a> in Southern polls. The region has a lot of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-key-to-the-gop-race-the-diploma-divide/">non-college educated</a>, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/iowa/exit/">moderate</a> white voters &#8212; a demographic group that is right in Trump&#8217;s wheelhouse. These voters used to be Democrats but over the past couple of decades have identified more and more as Republicans. They’re receptive to Trump’s populist pitch.</p><p>But four Southern-state polls that were taken mostly or completely after Trump’s second-place finish in last week’s Iowa caucuses show him barely leading or behind. (Weirdly, since Iowa, no one has conducted a poll of South Carolina, the next GOP contest after New Hampshire.)</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with Arkansas, where Mike Huckabee (who also has a tinge of populism to his pitch) served as governor. A <a href="http://talkbusiness.net/2016/02/poll-hillary-clinton-ted-cruz-hold-leads-in-democratic-gop-presidential-primaries/">Hendrix College poll</a> conducted late last week found Trump tied for second with Marco Rubio at 23 percent, while Ted Cruz led both with 27 percent.</p><p>Georgia was supposed to be one of Trump&#8217;s stronger states. It was so Democratic during the 20th century that not a single Republican governor was elected. A poll from <a href="http://landmarkcommunications.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/December-10th-2015-Georgia-GOP-Presidential-Preference-Primary-poll.pdf">Landmark Communications</a> in December had Trump towering over the field with 43 percent. The same pollster also found Trump <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/hillary-clinton-has-large-lead-over-sanders-new-ex/nqKkx/">ahead last week</a>, but with 27 percent. He was less than 10 percentage points in front of Cruz and a surging Rubio, each with 18 percent.</p><p>Perhaps the best sign for Trump is that he still leads in Florida, the home state of Rubio and Jeb Bush. However, Trump’s 27 percent in a new <a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/201026-marco-rubio-in-second-place-in-new-florida-poll">Florida Southern College</a> is the lowest percentage he&#8217;s received in <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/florida-republican/">any Florida poll</a> in nearly three months. Meanwhile, the 20 percent going to Rubio is the best he&#8217;s done there since October. (Keep in mind that Florida is filled with retirees from Trump&#8217;s native Northeast.)</p><p>Finally, North Carolina &#8212; it’s a state that Trump should want to do well in: It&#8217;s right next to the second primary state, South Carolina, and like New Hampshire, North Carolina <a href="http://www.ncvoter.org/who-can-vote/">allows unaffiliated voters</a>, whom Trump is expected to do <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2016/01/Topline-WBUR-NH-Primary-6-Independents.pdf">reasonably well with</a>, to vote in the Republican primary. Trump, though, received only 26 percent in the latest <a href="http://www.highpoint.edu/blog/2016/02/hpu-poll-clinton-leads-democratic-primary-trump-cruz-and-rubio-have-most-gop-support/">High Point University survey</a>, barely ahead of Cruz and Rubio, with 22 percent and 20 percent, respectively.</p><p>Any one of these surveys in isolation wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal for Trump. Indeed, if Trump wins New Hampshire, his numbers could bounce back. But the fact that he&#8217;s under 30 percent in four Southern states suggests that he&#8217;s vulnerable in the region. And Trump probably can’t count on the same divided field he’s facing now once the race makes it to the Southern contests in early March (Arkansas and Georgia vote March 1; Florida and North Carolina vote March 15).</p><p>The road after New Hampshire &#8212; win or lose &#8212; will be rougher.</p><p><strong><em>Check our our <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/new-hampshire-primary-presidential-election-2016/">live coverage and results from the New Hampshire Primary elections.</a></em></strong></p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-104103-7" preload="none" style="width: 100%; visibility: hidden;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3?_=7" /><a href="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3">http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3</a></audio><p><em>The FiveThirtyEight <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/elections-podcast/">elections podcast</a> team is in New Hampshire ahead of that state’s primary.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.</i></p><h2>$1,500 per hour</h2><p><span></span>Hourly rates at large corporate law firms have increased 3 percent to 4 percent per year since the recession, meaning that at several white shoe firms the hourly rate is north of $1,500 for senior partners. Must be nice. [<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/legal-fees-reach-new-pinnacle-1-500-an-hour-1454960708">The Wall Street Journal</a>]</p><hr /><h2>3.5-foot gator</h2><p>A Florida man was arrested Monday after throwing a 3.5-foot alligator through the drive-thru window of a Wendy&#8217;s restaurant back in October. The 23-year-old&#8217;s parents are saying it was just a prank, but here&#8217;s some free advice: Stop talking! I&#8217;m telling you, billing this as an elaborate if poorly thought out protest of the increasing price of the Baconator is the way to play this one. [<a href="http://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/loxahatchee-acreage/man-accused-of-tossing-gator-into-wendys-drive-thru-window">WPTV</a>]</p><hr /><h2>4-0</h2><p>It&#8217;s New Hampshire primary day! Dixville Notch, a small municipality nobody cares about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-1+day%2F4+years">99.93 percent</a> of the time, is the first town to vote in the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire presidential primary. It&#8217;s not a lot of people, but this year, Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 4-0, while on the Republican side, John Kasich got 3 votes to Donald Trump&#8217;s 2. [<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/09/politics/dixville-notch-new-hampshire-primary-midnight-vote/index.html">CNN</a>]</p><hr /><h2>10 percent</h2><p><span></span>After a year in which its most recognizable national figure was Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical lobby PhRMA is working on a public relations blitz this year. The business group is planning on spending 10 percent more on advertisements promoting the pharmaceutical business than it did in 2015. While it&#8217;s a whole different kind of P.R., PhRMA spent $18.4 million lobbying the federal government in 2014. [<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-industry-launches-ad-campaign-aimed-at-lawmakers-1454885145">The Wall Street Journal</a>]</p><hr /><h2>60 games</h2><p><span></span>The UConn Huskies women&#8217;s basketball team won a 60th consecutive victory after defeating the South Carolina Gamecocks.

He&#8217;s got a 70 percent chance of pulling it off. Somewhat surprisingly for people from New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie has less than a 1 percent chance of pulling off a win, down from 10 percent as recently as Christmas, despite spending a whole lot of time up there and <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/christietracker/">not so much down here</a>.

Marco Rubio leads the pack in Starbucks runs, dropping $386 at the chain compared to a mere $235 at Dunkin&#8217;.

Rick Snyder, who has been the subject of intense scrutiny as the city of Flint was left with poisonous lead-tainted water. The recall bid has to collect 789,133 signatures within a 60-day period over the next 180 days in order for the recall question to get on a state ballot.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MERRIMACK, N.H. &#8212; Perhaps the most eye-popping statistic to come out of last week’s Iowa caucuses was Bernie Sanders’s overwhelming advantage among young voters. According to the Iowa<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/01/us/elections/iowa-democrat-poll.html?_r=0"> entrance poll</a>, Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 84 percent to 14 percent among Democrats aged 17<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a> to 29. He also won voters aged 30 to 44 by a 21 percentage point margin. But Clinton easily won among voters aged 45 and older, allowing her to essentially tie with him in the state.<a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-republican/#polls-only"> Pre-election polls</a> in New Hampshire suggest that the age divisions in the Democratic electorate could be at least as dramatic here.</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="text" colspan="1">AGE</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">SANDERS</th><th class="heat number" colspan="1">CLINTON</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="text highlight bold">17-29</td><td class="heat number highlight bold" style="background-color:#ff9929;">84</td><td class="heat number highlight bold" style="background-color:#ffeedb;">14</td></tr><tr><td class="text">30-44</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffb86b;">58</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffd2a1;">37</td></tr><tr><td class="text">45-64</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffd4a6;">35</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffb86b;">58</td></tr><tr><td class="text">65+</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffdfbd;">26</td><td class="heat number" style="background-color:#ffab4f;">69</td></tr></tbody><caption>Sanders won Iowa&#8217;s youth vote overwhelmingly</caption></table><footer class="viz"><p class="source">Edison Research Iowa Entrance Poll</p></footer></section><p>These differences are really something. In 2008, Barack Obama<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929150114/http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4328"> performed better than Clinton among younger Democrats</a>, but not by nearly the margin that Sanders won them in Iowa. And although generational affinity might have explained some of Obama’s success with young voters &#8212; Obama was 46 years old at the time of the 2008 primaries &#8212; it doesn’t work for the 74-year-old Sanders, who is six years older than Clinton.</p><p>When you see a demographic trend this striking, it usually has multiple explanations. In this article, I’ll focus on how younger Americans view political labels like “socialist” and “libertarian” differently than older ones, and how that might be helping Sanders. I’ll explore several alternative explanations for Sanders’s support among young Americans in a follow-up article next week.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="8" href="#fn-8"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a></p><h2>Young voters have a more favorable view of socialism</h2><p>Bernie Sanders proudly describes himself as a “socialist” (or more commonly, as a “democratic socialist”). To Americans of a certain age, this is a potential liability. I’m just old enough (38) to have grown up during the Cold War, a time when “socialist” did not just mean “far left” but also implied something vaguely un-American. If you’re older than me, you may have even more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare">acutely negative associations with “socialism”</a> and may see it as a step on the road to communism. If you’re a few years younger than me, however, you may instead associate “socialism” with the social democracies of Northern Europe, which have high taxes and large welfare states. Sweden may not be your cup of tea, but it isn’t scary in the way the USSR was to people a generation ago.</p><p>Indeed, views of socialism are highly correlated with a voter’s age. According to a May 2015<a href="http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/3csd07d2dd/tabs_OPI_socialism_20150508.pdf"> YouGov</a> poll, conducted just before Sanders launched his campaign, a plurality of voters aged 18 to 29 had a favorable view of socialism. But among voters 65 and older, just 15 percent viewed socialism favorably, to 70 percent unfavorably.</p><figure id="attachment_104091"class="wp-caption alignnone "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-full wp-image-104091" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-bernieyouth-1.png?w=575&#038;h=448" alt="silver-bernieyouth-1" width="575" height="448" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-bernieyouth-1.png?w=575&amp;h=448 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-bernieyouth-1.png?w=1150&amp;h=448 2x" /></figure><h2>Young voters don’t necessarily back socialist economics</h2><p>That doesn’t mean America is undergoing a leftist or revolutionary awakening, however. The biennial<a href="http://gss.norc.org/"> General Social Survey</a> has a long-standing question about wealth redistribution, asking Americans whether the “government in Washington ought to reduce the income differences between the rich and the poor … perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving income assistance to the poor.” While no one question can summarize Sanders’s left-of-center economic program in a sentence, this is probably about as close as you’re going to get; his plan <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814798/bernie-sanders-tax-rates">would raise marginal tax rates to as high as 77 percent</a> on the very richest Americans to pay for a host of social programs.</p><p>The General Social Survey question asks respondents to place themselves on a 7-point scale ranging from favoring government efforts at redistribution to opposing them. To make things a little more intuitive, I’ve translated those responses to a 100-point scale, where 0 represents the most conservative/right-wing position (no redistribution!), and 100 the most liberal/left-wing position (hell yes, redistribution!). The chart below summarizes how both Americans overall and Americans aged 18-29 have responded to the question over time.</p><figure id="attachment_104090"class="wp-caption alignnone "style="max-width: 575px"><img class="size-full wp-image-104090" src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-bernieyouth-2.png?w=575&#038;h=448" alt="silver-bernieyouth-2" width="575" height="448" srcset="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-bernieyouth-2.png?w=575&amp;h=448 1x, https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/silver-bernieyouth-2.png?w=1150&amp;h=448 2x" /></figure><p>Americans end up pretty much in the middle of the road.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> Whereas 50 would represent an exactly centrist position, the average score among all Americans in 2014 (the most recent edition of the survey) was 54. Americans aged 18-29 scored a 60, just slightly further to the left. But these are really modest differences, and they haven’t changed much over time. In 1996, 20 years ago, the average response among all Americans was a 54, and the average among Americans aged 18-29 was a 59, almost exactly the same as now. It’s possible that Sanders will trigger a shift toward more support for economic redistribution in the future, but there hasn’t been one yet.</p><h2>What socialists and libertarians have in common</h2><p>Just as “socialism” is becoming more popular with young Americans, so is another label that implies a highly different set of economic policies. Americans aged 18-29 are<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2011/12/28/little-change-in-publics-response-to-capitalism-socialism/"> much more likely</a> than older generations to have a favorable view of the term “libertarian,” referring to a philosophy that favors free markets and small government. Indeed, the demographics of Sanders’s support now and Ron Paul’s support four years ago are <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/states/iowa/exit-polls">not all that different</a>: Both candidates got much more support from younger voters than from older ones, from men than from women, from white voters than from nonwhite ones, and from secular voters than from religious ones. Like Sanders, Paul drew more support from poorer voters than from wealthier ones in 2012, although that’s not true of libertarianism more generally.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a></p><p>If both “socialism” and “libertarianism” are popular among young voters, could it be that younger voters have a wider spread of opinions on economic redistribution, with more responses on both the “0” and “100” ends of the scale? It could be, but that’s not what the data shows. In fact, on the General Social Survey question I mentioned earlier, younger Americans were more likely than older ones to be concentrated toward the center and not toward the extremes on the redistribution issue.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a></p><p>The cynical interpretation of this is that the appeal of both “socialism” and “libertarianism” to younger Americans is more a matter of the labels than the policy substance. Relatedly, it’s hard to find all that much of a disagreement over core issues between Clinton and Sanders, who voted together <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/upshot/the-senate-votes-that-divided-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders.html">93 percent of the time</a> when they were both in the Senate from 2007 to 2009.</p><p>But terms such as “liberal” and “conservative” are fairly cynical also, at least in the way they’re applied in contemporary American politics. Rather than reflecting their <a href="http://www.belmont.edu/lockesmith/liberalism_essay/the_rise1.html">original</a>, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/abc-republican-debate-presidential-election-2016/?#livepress-update-15237280">philosophical meanings</a>, they instead tend to be used as euphemisms for the policy positions of the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively. Those parties’ platforms are not all that philosophically coherent, nor do they reflect the relatively <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/">diverse and multidimensional</a> political views of individual Americans. Instead, the major American political parties are best understood as <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-may-be-failing/">coalitions of interest groups</a> that work together to further one another’s agendas.</p><p>What’s distinctive about both the Sanders and Ron Paul coalitions is that they consist mostly of people who do not feel fully at home in the two-party system but are not part of historically underprivileged groups. On the whole, young voters lack political influence. But a young black voter might feel more comfortable within the Democratic coalition, which black political leaders have embraced, while a young evangelical voter might see herself as part of a wave of religious conservatives who long ago found a place within the GOP.</p><p>A young, secular white voter might not have a natural partisan identity, however, while surrounded by relatively successful peers. In part, then, the “revolutions” that both Sanders and Paul speak of are <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/Bernie-Sanders-and-the-revolution-of-rising-expectations.html">revolutions of rising expectations</a>. We’ll explore this theme more fully in Part II of the series, and consider some alternative explanations for Sanders’s success.</p><p><strong><em>Check our our <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/new-hampshire-primary-presidential-election-2016/">live coverage and results from the New Hampshire Primary elections.</a></em></strong></p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-104092-8" preload="none" style="width: 100%; visibility: hidden;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3?_=8" /><a href="http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3">http://c.espnradio.com/s:5L8r1/audio/2674709/fivethirtyeightelections_2016-02-08-112009.64k.mp3</a></audio><p><em>The FiveThirtyEight <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/elections-podcast/">elections podcast</a> team is in New Hampshire ahead of that state’s primary.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the rest of the country recovers from its post-Super Bowl hangover, the South Carolina women’s basketball team will attempt to do what only one team has accomplished in the last 35 months: beat Connecticut.</p><p>The UConn Huskies are in one of the most dominant stretches in college basketball history, winners of 59 straight and 106 of their last 107 games. The South Carolina Gamecocks are having an impressive season of their own, off to a 22-0 start for the second consecutive season. And Monday night&#8217;s game between the only undefeated teams in Division I basketball will be the 56th meeting between the AP’s No. 1 and No. 2 women’s college basketball teams. The last such meeting did not turn out so well for the Gamecocks, with No. 2 UConn beating No. 1 South Carolina, 87-62 in Storrs, last season to snap a 22-game win streak.</p><p>For any hope at a better result this season, the Gamecocks will need something special out of their dynamic duo on the interior, A’ja Wilson and Alaina Coates.</p><p>Wilson is the reigning SEC Freshman of the Year and top-ranked recruit for the Class of 2014,<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a> and she has elevated her game in her sophomore season, becoming South Carolina’s go-to player against ranked teams. The 6-foot-5-inch forward has accounted for 25.6 percent of South Carolina’s points and 26.3 percent of its rebounds against Top 25 opponents this season. Wilson had a tendency to disappear in big games last season, but she&#8217;s now averaging 26.6 points per 40 minutes against ranked teams and has a double-double in seven of her nine games against Top 25 opponents this season, more than she had all of last season.</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="text" colspan="1"></th><th class="number" colspan="1">PTS PER 40 MINS.</th><th class="number" colspan="1">FIELD GOAL PERCENTAGE</th><th class="number" colspan="1">DOUBLE-DOUBLES</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="text">2015-16</td><td class="number">26.6 points</td><td class="number">53.1%</td><td class="number">7</td></tr><tr><td class="text">2014-15</td><td class="number" style="padding-right:4.7em;">23.1</td><td class="number" style="padding-right:1.1em;">47.4</td><td class="number">2</td></tr></tbody><caption>A’ja Wilson against ranked teams for the last 2 seasons</caption></table></section><p>Coates, the 2013-14 SEC Freshman of the Year, leads the nation in field goal percentage and has an SEC-best 12 double-doubles this season. Coates and Wilson are averaging a combined 29.6 points per game, the most by any frontcourt duo in the SEC. Overall, South Carolina is averaging 40.3 points per game in the paint and has outscored its opponents down low in every game this season.</p><p>Based on their performance, the Wilson-Coates tandem could prove difficult for UConn to defend. Maryland’s Brionna Jones — one of the premier post players in the nation, with skills and stature similar to Wilson and Coates — put up 24 points against the Huskies earlier this season. UConn allowed a season-high 38 points in the paint to the Terrapins and trailed in the third quarter for the only time this season.</p><p>South Carolina is also aggressive on the offensive glass, averaging 8.6 points per game on put-backs<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a> and grabbing 13.7 offensive rebounds per game. Connecticut is allowing 10.7 offensive rebounds per game but the Huskies’ opposition has failed to capitalize, managing just 3.5 points per game on put-backs.</p><p>And don’t discount South Carolina’s home-court advantage. The Gamecocks have won 45 consecutive home games, the longest active streak in Division I, and are on track to lead the nation in attendance for the second consecutive season. Notably, South Carolina averages 80.2 points at home, compared to 68.4 points on the road.</p><p>But will a strong post presence and a favorable crowd be enough to hand Connecticut its first loss in over a year? Probably not. UConn is on pace to lead the nation in both offensive and defensive efficiency for the fourth consecutive season; to have a chance against Connecticut you need to score at least 70 points. Over the last five seasons, UConn is 5-7 when opponents score 70 or more points, compared to 163-3 when holding its opponent to 69 points or fewer.</p><p>And here&#8217;s the bad news for Gamecocks fans: South Carolina is tied for eighth in the nation in offensive efficiency but has been held below 70 points on seven occasions this season, four times against ranked teams.</p><p>The Gamecocks also struggle on 3-pointers and free throws, which isn&#8217;t ideal when you&#8217;re trying to run up a big number on the Huskies. South Carolina is shooting 31.4 percent from deep this season, which ranks 150th in Division I. In one of Connecticut’s most tightly contested games this season, Notre Dame shot 65 percent from beyond the arc, making 13 3-pointers. DePaul and South Florida also had early success against Connecticut, making 12 or more 3-pointers and shooting 45 percent or better from beyond the arc.</p><p>The view is even worse from the foul line, where South Carolina ranks 272nd in the nation with a 65.3 percent free throw percentage. Facing a Connecticut squad that holds opponents to a Division I-low 6.2 free throw attempts per game, the Gamecocks need to convert on any opportunity to put points on the board.</p><p>Is South Carolina capable of upsetting Connecticut on Monday night? It&#8217;s possible, sure. But SC will need either something truly absurd out of Wilson and Coates or a momentary reprieve from its season-long trend of their range extending no farther than the length of their arms.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104071&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; If there’s one thing years of quarterback data have taught us, it’s that QBs do poorly under pressure.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> In about a quarter of all dropbacks, the QB is under pressure, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, and in those cases, their QBR is 7.9.<a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> This is very bad. It is, to shine a little point of reference, JaMarcus Russell <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/qbr/_/year/0/type/alltime-season/order/false">on an off day</a>, and helps reverse engineer a John Madden quote: <i>When a quarterback is being harassed, he doesn&#8217;t have much of a chance.</i><a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> Great.</p><p>As it happens, Cam Newton did not have much of a chance in Super Bowl 50. Stats &amp; Info has him down for 48 dropbacks, of which 21 were pressured. His QBR on those 21 plays was 2.6; for the game, it was 16.9 &#8212; just a hair over his 15.6 mark on <i>pressured</i> plays for the season. He was sacked six times, hit 15 times (five on plays that didn&#8217;t generate a &#8220;pressure&#8221;) and blitzed 25 times. He threw an interception, and a few other balls sailed high, and he gave up two fumbles in his own red zone that would result in 15 points for the Broncos. It was, as our MaddenBot might say, a very bad day for Cam Newton.</p><p>(Peyton Manning was pressured on 11 of 28 dropbacks, and had a similarly miserable 2.5 QBR on those plays.)</p><p>Days like Sunday didn&#8217;t happen to Newton very often this season. Through the league championship, he was pressured 179 times in 654 dropbacks, or 27.4 percent. (His QBR on those plays was 15.6.) Going by pressures per dropback, the Panthers played only four top-10 pressure defenses this season. During the regular season, the Texans, Seahawks and Colts each played the Panthers tight and held Cam under 50 QBR (and under 80 in the traditional passer rating), but the Panthers defense and general mediocrity of those teams carried Carolina on through. In the divisional round rematch against the Seahawks, defensive end Cliff Avril &#8212; one of Seattle&#8217;s best pass rushers &#8212; left the game in the second quarter and didn&#8217;t return. The Seahawks pressured Cam just twice all game. The Cardinals brought pressure six times in the conference championship, a season-low for them.</p><section class="viz"><table class="viz full"><thead><tr><th class="text" colspan="1">TEAM</th><th

class="source">Source: TruMedia</p></footer></section><p>This may be compelling evidence that Carolina simply stumbled in the big one, having just clubbed the second- and third-best pressure defenses in back-to-back playoff games. But Seattle and Arizona are both hugely different defenses from Denver. The Seahawks are a low-blitz team that relies on a killer secondary. The Cardinals also relied more on coverage before free safety Tyrann Mathieu went down for the year, but they also leaned heavily on blitz packages; their one-on-one pass-rushing was so anemic that 35-year-old Dwight Freeney led the team with eight sacks &#8212; and no other Cardinal had more than five.</p><p>As you saw Sunday, that is not at all how the Broncos play defense.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>To illustrate this, I&#8217;ve created a series of charts and graphs.

Haffey / Getty Images; chart by Allison McCann</p></figcaption></figure><p>As the data shows, Newton was well and truly, uh, accounted for.</p><div class='ornamental-rule'><hr /><span></span></div><p>On the first fumble of the game, the one that set things spinning, Von Miller wheeled around the edge, sized up right tackle Mike Remmers like he was riding down on a quintain, and crashed past him and into Newton, knocking the ball out and into the end zone, all within something like two-and-a-half-Mississippi.</p><p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='575' height='354' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/5dk0KqS2Pb4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p><p>Miller circled back around on Remmers often enough to run up 2.5 sacks, 2 more hits and a half-dozen more near-thumpings. We have stats that can reflect what a player does <i>in</i> a game, but not as much what he does <i>to</i> it. The old Bill James line is that baseball stats can acquire the powers of language, telling a story or calling a game all on their own. Those Broncos numbers are burly enough to carry luggage, but they don&#8217;t quite have the powers to tell you how different the game looks when the pocket collapses before the snap finds the center&#8217;s ass.</p><p>This works the other way around as well. Cam&#8217;s numbers aren&#8217;t getting any prettier no matter how you slice them. But at least twice Sunday he carried a defender on his back as he wound up and got a throw off toward the sticks &#8212; incomplete pass, but not a sack. They were hand-to-God some of the most impressive feats of strength I&#8217;ve witnessed. There aren&#8217;t stats for that, at least not in the ESPN database, as there aren&#8217;t any for something like whispering a third-quarter pass 30 yards in the air, over the shoulder of the defender and into Jerricho Cotchery&#8217;s breadbasket at the 5-yard line, only for the defender &#8212; a linebacker sprinting 25 yards downfield &#8212; to close at the last second and knock it out. It was just Cotchery&#8217;s third drop of the season; it also happened to be his third drop of the game. The streaking &#8216;backer was Miller, naturally, who was named the game’s MVP.</p><p>After the game, receiver Devin Funchess was one of the few Panthers to serve up more than platitudes &#8212; if just barely &#8212; about preparing for Miller and the rest of Denver’s defense. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that in practice,&#8221; he said, asked about preparing for the rush versus actually having to play against it. &#8220;Our guys can&#8217;t mimic that.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s true of the stats just as much as it is of the players. Other teams may have pressure numbers that resemble what this Denver defense put together this season, but only because our tools of observation remain imperfect. Near as we can tell, the Broncos are the best defense the Panthers faced in a postseason flush with top units. But for really unusual teams, our best guesses can often be far enough out that we can&#8217;t fully appreciate what it is that we&#8217;re watching without accepting that greatness affects the game in ways we can&#8217;t yet fully capture.</p><p>Or, as Madden might tell you just as easily, <i>When you have great players playing great, well, that’s great football.</i><a class="footnote-link" data-expandable="entry-footnotes" data-footnote-id="17" href="#fn-17"><sup id="ss-17">17</sup></a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fivethirtyeight.com&#038;blog=64146350&#038;post=104001&#038;subd=espnfivethirtyeight&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>You’re reading Significant Digits, a daily digest of the telling numbers tucked inside the news.</i></p><h2>1.92 points</h2><p>FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s Oscar race model tracks the lead-up to the Academy Awards and assigns points to nominees based on picking up prizes at earlier, historically predictive awards shows. This past Saturday, Alejandro González Iñárritu, the director of &#8220;The Revenant,&#8221; won his second consecutive Directors Guild of America award. In doing so, he rocketed to the lead in the race for best director at the Oscars, and also pushed his film to the top of the heap in the best picture category with 1.92 points. The win made a two-film best picture race into a three-film best picture predictive nightmare, with &#8220;The Revenant,&#8221; &#8220;The Big Short&#8221; and &#8220;Spotlight&#8221; all legitimate contenders with strong institutional support for the prize.

Carolina was favored in the event, with Denver only a 41.5 percent chance of victory. This makes it the seventh-biggest upset in Super Bowl history according to the FiveThirtyEight Elo model.

Trump is heavily favored to win with a projected 27.7 percent of the vote. It&#8217;s the race for second place here that is interesting, with Gov. John Kasich a surprising contender for the silver medal: he&#8217;s projected to get 14.6 percent of the vote, which as someone who has been paying nowhere near as much attention as I probably should be was kind of surprising! He still trails Sen. Marco Rubio&#8217;s projected vote share — 17 percent — but it&#8217;s worth seeing how this shakes out over the next few days.

About 400 of the brand-name drugs studies saw their price increase 9.9 percent on average since December.

The event is slated to begin on Feb. 15.

That&#8217;s a rate of 345 per day. Like most things regarding U.S. imports, many of those came from Canada (508,325 trophies &#8212; thanks for the animal bodies, neighbor!), but the runner up was South Africa with 383,982 trophies.
