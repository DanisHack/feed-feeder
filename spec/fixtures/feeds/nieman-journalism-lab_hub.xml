				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times is shuttering its tech blog, Bits, as a separate destination. From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/technology/a-new-look-and-feel-for-bits.html">a post Wednesday</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Bits was born, blogs were the path toward a digital future. They were the only way for us to publish quickly, without the constraints of print deadlines and production. No more. We now have a home-grown publishing system that allows us to more seamlessly integrate our tech coverage across the web, apps, print, social media — everywhere you find our journalism.</p>
<p>So for clarity and simplicity, the blog goes away and all tech stories will now carry the label of Tech.</p>
<p>You will still see the Bits identifier on some of our journalism. The Bits email newsletter will continue, as will Bits special sections and daily reports that summarize the big news of the day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2014/almost-half-of-the-nyts-blogs-will-close-or-merge/256936/">did a big rethink of its blogs in 2014</a>, shutting down almost half of them. &#8220;There’s little chance that our marquee blogs, ones like DealBook, Well, Bits, will be going anywhere anytime soon,&#8221; then-assistant managing editor Ian Fisher (he&#8217;s now head of the Times&#8217; investigations department) told Poynter at the time.</p>
<p>Last November, the Times <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/how-one-blog-helped-spark-the-new-york-times-digital-evolution/">shut down the eight-year-old City Room</a>. For more on how blogs sparked and changed the Times&#8217; digital evolution, you&#8217;ll want to read my colleague Joseph Lichterman&#8217;s entire oral history, but here&#8217;s what one former Times employee told him:</p>
<blockquote><p>The success of a lot of the blogs was, in some ways, part of their downfall. For lack of a better term, they started competing with the existing sections.</p></blockquote>
<p>The list of remaining Times blogs is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/blogs/directory.html">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hiking through the hills above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otta,_Norway">Otta, Norway</a>, a town of 1,700 about a four-hour drive north of Oslo, a team from the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK realized it would have to take a new approach to filming the vistas for the <a href="http://www.nrk.no/bygda-som-sa-nei-1.12703629">interactive documentary</a> it was creating.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/NRK_Vertical.jpg" alt="NRK_Vertical" width="300" height="531" class="nakedrightimage" />As part of a company-wide effort to improve mobile strategy, the documentary — which focused on how Otta was adapting to a refugee center that opened in a shuttered hotel — was filmed vertically, using a camera rotated 90 degrees to the side. Staffers built a special grip to hold the camera steadily sideways. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you go up to the Norwegian mountains, it&#8217;s really beautiful, and you&#8217;re used to seeing the landscape in horizontal mode,&#8221; NRK&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/kimjan">Kim Jansson</a>, who led the project, told me. </p>
<p>&#8220;You need to adjust your way of thinking. &#8216;OK, we need to cut off the left and right sides, what can we do to make it work vertically?&#8217; We used trees to make people see how tall things are: How big the mountains are, how tall the buildings are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can get a different perspective. You just have to change your mind a little bit to see the opportunities that you don&#8217;t have when you&#8217;re filming horizontally.&#8221;</p>
<p>As mobile consumption continues to grow, news outlets — especially those publishing on Snapchat Discover — are turning to vertical video, a format that was once <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5915888/an-important-psa-on-why-you-should-never-shoot-videos-vertically">widely derided</a>, to optimize their content for viewing on phones. </p>
<p>According to analyst <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">Mary Meeker</a>, users use vertically oriented devices nearly <a href="https://recodetech.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-27-at-7-48-59-am.png">30 percent of the time</a>, up from just 5 percent in 2010. And <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-11/snapchat-s-daily-mobile-video-views-said-to-rival-facebook-s">more than 7 billion videos</a> are viewed each day on Snapchat, which is specifically designed for vertical consumption.</p>
<p>But even as outlets ranging from National Geographic to Mashable and Vox create vertical videos, there&#8217;s no consensus on the best way to actually produce them. Some organizations, such as NRK, decided to rotate their cameras and film vertically, while others have decided to shoot the traditional horizontal way and then adapt the footage to fit a vertical screen. </p>
<p>While shooting vertically can present simple logistical problems (what&#8217;s the best way to secure a camera sideways on a tripod?), the unorthodox orientation forces producers to alter their shot compositions and techniques regardless of how the video is shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The apparatus is a bit of a stumbling block for anyone trying to use a traditional camera to create vertical video,&#8221; said <a href="http://www.adamsebire.info/">Adam Sébire</a>, the co-founder of the <a href="http://www.verticalfilmfestival.com.au/">Vertical Film Festival</a> in Australia, which has published a <a href="http://www.verticalfilmfestival.com.au/9-16-tips-and-tricks/">guide to filming vertically</a>. </p>
<p>Beyond simply creating the video, presenting it can be a challenge. NRK&#8217;s existing video player didn&#8217;t accommodate vertical video, so its developers had to quickly build a new player specifically for the refugee film. YouTube just last summer <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/23/9029699/youtube-for-ios-updated-to-support-better-vertical-video-playback">updated its mobile apps</a> to allow for vertical playback that takes up the whole screen.</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s seamless handling of vertical video is one reason publishers are focusing their efforts on that platform. National Geographic was one of the original publishers on Snapchat Discover, but it wasn&#8217;t until this past September that it committed to presenting all of its Snapchat videos vertically, said <a href="http://www.burningtoast.com/">James Williams</a>, National Geographic&#8217;s director of digital video. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/NatGeoVerticalVideo.jpeg" alt="NatGeoVerticalVideo" width="300" height="534" class="nakedleftimage"/>National Geographic has repurposed some horizontal video for Snapchat, but it&#8217;s also shooting some videos, like a regular quiz show, in vertical. Once Williams got over the mental block of &#8220;shooting video in the same dimensions that my mom shoots video of her dog in her backyard,&#8221; the digital team had to figure the best way to frame stories vertically.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you come up through your career, you get used to communicating within certain dimensions,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;You learn to use that space in a very effective way, in terms of how you balance the shot compositions or place the subject in focus. To suddenly lop off the sides and have to completely rethink how you’re framing things — to me, that was the largest challenge. There was a period of experimentation and the feeling of relief that we can still tell great stories in new dimensions.&#8221; </p>
<p>For the videos it films vertically, National Geographic mounts the camera on its side, but there is no leeway to edit the video or change its dimensions. Meanwhile, a horizontally filmed video that is edited into the vertical format can be used for multiple purposes. &#8220;It&#8217;s a commitment,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/MashableVertical.jpeg" alt="MashableVertical" width="300" height="534" class="nakedrightimage" />Mashable has decided its best bet is to just film horizontally. In its early days on Snapchat Discover, Mashable tried filming vertically by using a phone camera and by flipping a DSLR camera sideways. Later, it decided to shoot all its videos on a camera that&#8217;s oriented horizontally, said Mashable creative director <a href="https://twitter.com/thebeff">Jeff Petriello</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of quality, and for the content to live on in as many forms as possible, shooting it on at least a 4K camera horizontal has proven to be the most efficient,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Petriello estimated that only a third of the vertical content Mashable creates actually requires a camera. The rest is created through animation and design using programs such as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html">Adobe After Effects</a>. </p>
<p>Vox also predominantly uses animations for its Snapchat Discover channel, and <a href="https://twitter.com/YvonneLeow">Yvonne Leow</a>, Vox&#8217;s senior Snapchat editor, said there&#8217;s been &#8220;a bit of a learning curve&#8221; as Vox&#8217;s designers figured out the best ways to create graphics or other visualizations for a vertical screen. </p>
<p>When it does use live video on Snapchat Discover, Vox shoots horizontally. If Vox is shooting an in-studio interview, the videographer will frame the subject in the center of the frame so the video can be easily readjusted to a vertical orientation.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZaekogALkFM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Vox also lays graphics over its interviews, and by using a center-focused shot, it&#8217;s able to adapt the graphics to the orientation of the final version.</p>
<p>The New York Times took this approach last year when it produced a video about the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/the-new-york-times-wrestled-with-many-dimensions-of-video-to-visualize-the-making-of-a-hit/">collaboration by Justin Bieber, Skrillex, and Diplo</a>. It produced three different versions of the video — a 16:9 ratio for its own player and YouTube, 3:4 for tablets, and 9:16 for a vertical orientation on phones — and adjusted the graphics for each view. </p>
<p>Figuring out the best way to present vertical video on screens that aren&#8217;t phones can take a little ingenuity.</p>
<p>Mashable has published a handful of vertical videos <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/08/03/dominique-ansel-desserts/#X1pZrXz1s5qz">outside of Snapchat Discover</a>, and when they&#8217;re viewed on desktop, those videos are embedded in the left-hand column of a story.</p>
<p>For its interactive about the refugees, NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster, showed large quotes next to the vertical video when it was viewed on desktop. </p>
<p>But NRK estimated that 66 percent of viewers watched the videos on mobile, and the interactive was one of NRK&#8217;s most-consumed stories of 2015, even though it wasn&#8217;t published until the last week of December. </p>
<p>Jansson&#8217;s team is heading back into the field this month to begin its next vertical documentary. This time, they&#8217;ll try to add more motion into the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a lot happening in the videos last time around,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to see if it&#8217;s possible to make that work a little bit better this time. But we&#8217;re going to do more or less the same thing. We&#8217;ve only done this once through, and we need more practice.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you think of when you think of <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/">The Christian Science Monitor</a>? Well, the news organization <em>hopes</em> that you think of it as a place that&#8217;s been providing &#8220;calming context on global news&#8221; since 1908, in the words of weekly magazine editor <a href="https://twitter.com/CSMWeeklyClay">Clayton Collins</a>. And this week, the Monitor launched a new social media initiative, &#8220;The Redirect,&#8221; that aims to offer a counter-narrative to gloom in the news.</p>
<p>This is &#8220;absolutely an acquisition strategy,&#8221; Collins said.</p>
<p>Right now, when you visit <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/ds/index.html">The Redirect</a>, you&#8217;ll see a number of cards focused on Islamic extremism. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-12.04.42-PM.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-10 at 12.04.42 PM" width="600" height="417" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>Some of the cards expand when you click on a little &#8220;More&#8221; link, sending you back to a Monitor article on the topic. Each is accompanied by links to share the image on Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know our audience cares about progress,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-paardecamp-hackney-a2558317">Susan Hackney</a>, the Monitor&#8217;s chief marketing and strategy officer. &#8220;They&#8217;re not Pollyannaish, but they want to see and participate in change in a positive way. They&#8217;re the kind of people that get involved to make their communities better. This offers them data that suggests there&#8217;s a more positive spin [on the news] and gives them ammunition for the kinds of conversations they want to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Monitor will track how many shares each card gets and is also asking for the email addresses of visitors to the site.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Safety is trending: <a href="https://t.co/AuzRjVTaTi">https://t.co/AuzRjVTaTi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FightTheFear?src=hash">#FightTheFear</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShareHope?src=hash">#ShareHope</a> <a href="https://t.co/aSSYPfWylE">pic.twitter.com/aSSYPfWylE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CS Monitor (@csmonitor) <a href="https://twitter.com/csmonitor/status/697468924833763328">February 10, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The initiative, which was rolled out after a three-week &#8220;sprint&#8221; by seven team members from across the organization along with consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/khopper">Keith Hopper</a>, is undoubtedly modest. When I saw the cards with the &#8220;more&#8221; links, I was expecting <a href="http://www.vox.com/cards">Vox-like card stacks</a> that would expand to offer a great deal more background information; instead, you get one or two sentences and a link to an article. To be fair, though, The Redirect has only been around for a day, and the Monitor plans to expand the project based on reader feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;It remains to be seen whether this is a long-term offering, or a bridge to something else,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to see what the appetite is for this sort of antidote approach to news.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times this week has launched a <a href="http://www.nytco.com/first-nyt-higher-ed-newsletter-the-edit-launches/">new email newsletter</a> aimed at college students that will feature <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/2016/02/08/the-edit?nlid=90661">a collection of stories</a> that will help students &#8220;through their next steps, both professional and personal, in a way that doesn’t come across as prescriptive.&#8221; </p>
<p>The newsletter, named The Edit, will be sent out every other week, and it&#8217;s just the Times&#8217; latest attempt to target college students. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/2016/02/08/the-edit?nlid=90661">first issue of the newsletter</a>, sent out Monday, includes stories on study abroad programs, Bernie Sanders, beer ads, and a guide to making eggs. </p>
<p>The paper offers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/AcademicRate">discounted subscriptions</a> to students and faculty. It also has a program where universities can purchase licenses to access the Times online or purchase subscriptions in bulk for distribution on campus. </p>
<p>For the Times, The Edit is part of an attempt to encourage a younger readership to develop an attachment to the Times — readers who could be converted into the future subscribers, key to its future growth and plans to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/4-takeaways-from-the-new-york-times-new-digital-strategy-memo/">reach $800 million in digital revenue by 2020</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/lpologreen">Lydia Polgreen</a> told me about the Times&#8217; <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/02/en-espanol-the-new-york-times-launches-a-spanish-language-news-site-aiming-south-of-the-border/">new Spanish-language site</a>, “Our main goal in this is to get people to think of The New York Times as an important part of their daily lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Edit newsletter is another attempt to build that relationship with college students. Newsletters have become <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-you-need-to-know-how-six-publishers-digest-the-news-for-their-readers/">trendy recently</a> as publishers look to offer readers finite products that are mobile friendly. </p>
<p>&#8220;We believe email is how people really communicate with each other, especially when we looked at the morning routines of our target audience,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/dmweisberg">Danielle Weisberg</a>, one of the cofounders of <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/08/how-the-skimms-passionate-readership-helped-its-newsletter-grow-to-1-5-million-subscribers/">theSkimm</a>, an email newsletter aimed at young professional women, told the Lab last year. </p>

<p>The Times now has more than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters">40 different newsletters</a>, including its daily morning and evening briefings, which originated as a feature on NYT Now. <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/new-york-times-gets-70-percent-open-rate-newsletters/">Digiday reported</a> last August that for its weekly emails, the Times&#8217; average gross open rate is about 50 percent, though that figure includes emails that were opened more than once. </p>

<blockquote><p>The stories chosen for the briefings don’t mimic the homepage. These are not news summaries. We’re conscious of short paragraphs and sentences, of what’s pleasant to read on a phone screen. For example, in the morning briefing, there are few news items that are more one or two sentences long. If you want more information, you click on the links. The number of items included in the briefing depends on the day, and there’s no hard and fast rule on that.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To <a href="https://twitter.com/steveprattca">Steve Pratt</a>, one of the biggest benefits of branded podcasts is that they don&#8217;t contain advertising.</p>
<p>Of course, branded podcasts are, by definition, a form of advertising in and of themselves. But Pratt, who leads what he believes is the only company dedicated solely to producing podcasts for other companies, says the hallmark of a good branded podcast is that the marketing is subtle.</p>
<p>The biggest project that Pratt&#8217;s Vancouver-based company, <a href="http://pacific-content.com/">Pacific Content</a>, has worked on so far is Slack&#8217;s podcast, <a href="https://slack.com/varietypack">The Slack Variety Pack</a>. Now the company is adding more clients. On Monday, it <a href="http://pacific-content.com/new-podcast-announcing-tgim-shopify/">launched a podcast</a> with e-commerce software company <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>. In the coming weeks, it will add offerings from visitor registration software company <a href="https://envoy.com/">Envoy</a> and education company <a href="https://www.hobsons.com/">Hobsons</a>.</p>
<p>If e-commerce and visitor registration software don&#8217;t sound like particularly interesting topics to you, rest assured that that isn&#8217;t what the podcasts are about. One thing all of Pacific Content&#8217;s clients have in common, Pratt said, is that they &#8220;understand this is something where you want to build a long-term relationship with people. It&#8217;s not about short-term conversions, or anything like that, but about having an amazing first experience with a brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Shopify&#8217;s podcast, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/podcasts/tgim">TGIM</a>, will focus on entrepreneurship. &#8220;It&#8217;s a general, broad show meant to be valuable for any entrepreneur who is running a business of their own or is thinking about running a business on their own at some point,&#8221; said Shopify content marketing manager <a href="https://twitter.com/mark_macdonald">Mark Macdonald</a>. It&#8217;s part of Shopify&#8217;s larger plan to launch an entire network of podcasts; it launched one last year called <a href="https://www.shopify.com/podcasts/shopify-masters">Shopify Masters</a>, with the jargon-filled tagline &#8220;Actionable Strategies for Ambitious Ecommerce Entrepreneurs. &#8220;The audience is hopefully going to be much wider&#8221; for the Pacific Content podcast, Macdonald said. The <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tgim-podcast/episode-01-what-they-dont-teach-you-in-business-school-and-what-they-do-teach-you-in-prison">first episode</a> is entitled &#8220;What they DON&#8217;T teach you in business school and what they DO teach you in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/245970759&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></p>
<p>Pacific Content director Pratt worked as the director of digital music at the CBC for 10 years; in 2004, he launched one of the station&#8217;s first music podcasts. But in that pre-smartphone era, podcasts &#8220;kind of dipped and went away as something that people cared about or talked about much,&#8221; he noted. In mid-2014, he left the CBC to cofound Pacific Content as a branded content company that did strategy work and consulting for companies like Telus and CBC.</p>
<p>At the very start, podcasts weren&#8217;t part of the picture. But, like plenty of others, Pratt pointed to the launch of <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> in fall 2014 as a turning point, &#8220;when podcasting felt like it was back and there was an appetite to do really high-quality programming that wasn&#8217;t there before. And absolutely nobody was doing it with brands.&#8221; At that point, he and partner <a href="http://ouano.ca/">Jennifer Ouano</a> decided to turn the company&#8217;s focus completely to branded podcasts.</p>
<p>Today, Pacific Content has 10 employees, eight of whom are full-time (the site also recently put out a call for freelancers around the world). Many team members previously worked at the CBC, and the company <a href="http://pacific-content.com/chris-boyce-joins-the-rapidly-growing-pacific-content-team/">just announced the hiring</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisoboyce">Chris Boyce</a>, the former executive director of CBC Radio.</p>
<p>Slack was the first company that Pacific Content pitched. &#8220;They&#8217;d been sponsoring and putting ads in podcasts. They are a really nontraditional company that&#8217;s pretty imaginative in the way they solve problems. They felt like exactly the right fit to say, here&#8217;s a brand-new idea,&#8221; Pratt recalled. Slack &#8220;got it right away,&#8221; and the first episode of Slack Variety Pack launched in May 2015. By the end of the year, there were 17 episodes and more than 3 million listens.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246051196&#038;color=ff5500"></iframe></p>
<p>Pacific Content has developed a &#8220;program development process&#8221; that it goes through with each of its clients to help ensure that their podcasts will be &#8220;audience-first, terrific shows&#8221; through which listeners will &#8220;understand what the company is all about, without any heavy-handed messaging.&#8221; In these meetings, which take place in the clients&#8217; offices over a few days, Pacific Content also seeks to learn the company&#8217;s culture, &#8220;their brand voice and their brand values, who they&#8217;d like to reach, and marrying those two.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Shopify&#8217;s podcast will be &#8220;a mix of stories about entrepreneurs and small business owners: Their journey to figuring out either how to leave their existing career and build their own business, or how they&#8217;ve overcome challenges to find success with their business.&#8221; That podcast will be about 30 minutes long. Registration software company Envoy&#8217;s podcast, meanwhile, will be much shorter, consisting of three- to five-minute episodes about office hacks. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to go around and profile businesses that are doing really cool things with their offices — Astroturf as carpeting, a wall made of Lego,&#8221; Pratt explained. &#8220;Again, it&#8217;s not about [their product] at all, it&#8217;s more about what they stand for.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Pratt if there are companies that <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> make branded podcasts. Sure, Pacific Content&#8217;s fairly new, but has it met with companies that just don&#8217;t get it, or have ideas that are too boring? One of the reasons for these process workshops, Pratt said, is to make sure podcasts and clients are a good fit. &#8220;It depends on the audience you&#8217;re trying to reach: Is this the right medium for reaching them, and is the cost of doing that effective compared to other channels?&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you wanted to make a really high-end podcast and only needed to reach 10 people with it, or if your audience is CEOs of aerospace companies — maybe a podcast isn&#8217;t the right way to reach those people. But I think we&#8217;re only at the beginning of figuring out all the different kinds of formats and storytelling techniques that are going to be fits for different brands&#8217; needs.&#8221;</p>
<p><blockquote class="fullpullquote"><span data-pullquote="&#8220;If your audience is CEOs of aerospace companies, maybe a podcast isn&#8217;t the right way to reach those people.&#8221;"></span></blockquote></p>
<p>In the case of Slack Variety Pack, Pacific Content has seen a lot of success in <a href="https://slack.com/varietypack/episode-20">dividing each 30-minute episode up</a> into four to six chunks that are all released as individual stories (in addition to being released as full-length episodes). The company plans to do the same with each 30-minute Shopify episode. Chunking-up optimizes the podcasts for sharing on SoundCloud, Facebook, and Twitter, and some of Slack&#8217;s &#8220;single servings&#8221; have gotten between 70 and 100,000 listens.</p>
<p>Pratt is also bullish on&#8230;the lack of advertising in Pacific Content&#8217;s podcasts. The podcasts are sponsored by companies, clearly. But &#8220;it&#8217;s a much better listening experience for an audience. There are no interruptions for two or three minutes in the middle of a story. There are no top and tail ad breaks. There are no coupon codes.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be fair, lack of ads isn&#8217;t the only reason you&#8217;d listen to something. I&#8217;d still choose to listen to one of my favorite ad-supported podcasts over a company-sponsored podcast with no ads. But maybe that&#8217;s in part because there still aren&#8217;t that many branded podcasts out there; a lot of the companies that I like or identify with aren&#8217;t doing podcasts. (I definitely enjoyed listening to the ad-free <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/how-did-the-ge-branded-podcast-the-message-hit-no-1-on-itunes-in-part-by-sounding-nothing-like-an-ad/">The Message, sponsored by GE</a>. And if, down the line, a company like Amazon decided to start releasing ad-free podcasts on a variety of topics, as it&#8217;s done with Prime Instant Video, I&#8217;d listen for sure. That&#8217;s more similar to Earwolf&#8217;s paywall approach with its premium Howl membership offering.) For now, it&#8217;s not that inconvenient to skip ahead 30 seconds when an ad break comes on. Down the line, though, it&#8217;s easy to imagine some kind of podcasting technology that doesn&#8217;t allow users to skip ads, just the way it&#8217;s not possible on a lot of streaming TV sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the reason I left traditional media is that the traditional advertising model is broken,&#8221; Pratt said. &#8220;The technology allows everybody to skip the things that they don&#8217;t want. The more people are skipping through the ways [a company] makes money, the worse the model is from a brand perspective. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to insert the things that people don&#8217;t like into the things that people do like. Our whole business model is that companies need to become the media companies themselves, make things that people like, and build their own audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>For each company, that will mean something different — and Pratt cited this lack of a one-size-fits-all model as a justification for skirting my question about how much Pacific Content&#8217;s offerings cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not the least expensive solution out there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, man. Compared to other mediums, like video and that sort of thing, audio is a terrific, terrific choice to reach a lot of people at a good price point.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts. This is Issue Fifty-Nine, published February 9, 2016.</p>
<p>Happy Lunar New Year!</p>
<p><strong>The Tow Center&#8217;s &#8220;Why Podcasting Matters.&#8221;</strong> And so there I was, once again, at <a href="http://www.thegreenespace.org/">The Greene Space</a>, WNYC&#8217;s live events venue, for yet another podcast-related shindig. I&#8217;ve grown fond of the venue over the past year, come to appreciate cozy size, its glossy floors, its neon-shaded walls that never fail to evoke <em>Miami Vice</em>. </p>
<p>The shindig in question was a panel called &#8220;Why Podcasting Matters.&#8221; It was designed around the publication of <a href="http://towcenter.org/research/guide-to-podcasting/">a Tow Center Report</a>, prepared by <a href="https://twitter.com/vmquirk">Vanessa Quirk</a>, that serves as a pretty good primer for the podcast industry at the end of 2015. It was a fine gathering, but I was mildly bothered by the name of the panel, as one would imagine. Partially because it&#8217;s never a particularly encouraging sign for an industry to still have to explain itself, but mostly because its premise is remarkably mid-2000s. It&#8217;s like being asked to make the case why blogging matters, or why the digitalization of media matters. Like, how many different variations of the same argument must we make?</p>
<p>But I understand, begrudgingly, the continuing need to stick with introductions. After all, I&#8217;m told that it&#8217;s still very early days for podcasting (11 years now since it first gained some noticeable amount of traction; that&#8217;s one year older than the birth of YouTube). There is still a lot more pie to grow.</p>
<p>Anyway, the panel was made up of <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/people/sarah-van-mosel/">Sarah van Mosel</a> (chief commercial officer, <a href="https://www.acast.com/">Acast</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/andybowers">Andy Bowers</a> (chief creative officer, <a href="http://www.panoply.fm/">Panoply</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/mlieber">Matt Lieber</a> (president, <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/">Gimlet Media</a>), and <a href="https://www.prx.org/user/khoffman">Kerri Hoffman</a> (chief operating officer, <a href="http://www.prx.org/">PRX</a>), and it was moderated by <a href="https://twitter.com/paulaszuchman">Paula Szuchman</a> (VP of on-demand content, <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/">WNYC</a>). The panel was fine and interesting, ranging widely in subject from branded advertising to &#8220;where are you finding your next hit?&#8221; to children-targeted podcasts and the mortifying guilt of surrendering your child to the television.</p>
<p>You can find a recording of the event <a href="http://www.thegreenespace.org/events/thegreenespace/2016/feb/04/wnyc-and-tow-center-digital-journalism-present-why-podcasting-matters/">here</a>, and you can read Quirk&#8217;s Tow Center report <a href="http://towcenter.org/research/guide-to-podcasting/">here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://livestream.com/accounts/955973/events/4599683/videos/111465050/player?width=600&#038;height=338&#038;autoPlay=false&#038;mute=false" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>But here are the two things that stood out to me as particularly interesting:</p>
<p><strong>1. What is the nature of the news podcast?</strong> There was a point in the panel, somewhere during a discussion about whether podcasts can be seen as a viable supplement to broadcast radio, where the panelists broached the subject of the &#8220;news podcast&#8221; — what is it, what is its nature within an on-demand context, and where is it headed.</p>
<p>This is a <em>fabulous</em> question, and it&#8217;s something that I think about quite a lot. For the record, I think anything that&#8217;s broadcasted can be adequately adapted to the on-demand format. The only major exception (other than Brian Lehrer, I suppose) is an ongoing breaking news scenario, which is typically best served by a live news broadcast. This, I must say, is a grave exception. I felt the limitations of on-demand audio most acutely during the Paris terror attacks; I had spent much of that evening at work glued to my Twitter feed, and when I left for my commute home — a subway trip usually reserved for pre-loaded programming — I chose instead to walk back over the Brooklyn Bridge so I could keep tabs on the news broadcast over the WNYC streaming app. But then again, getting my live updates through the stream was in its own way suboptimal; important information about actual developments was relatively sparse, and the bulk of what I ended up consuming at the end was largely filler or recycled exposition. (Perhaps that&#8217;s the real value of a live news broadcast; not necessarily the advancements in what we know, but merely the ambient knowledge that a news team is observing, that the world is continuing to spin.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a few months, and I&#8217;ve come to feel that this wasn&#8217;t an expression of on-demand audio&#8217;s limitations, but rather an example of the distribution channel not being utilized effectively enough with breaking news in mind. That&#8217;s because we are already seeing some really interesting experiments with news distribution using podcast feeds that, in their own ways, are bold attempts to grasp real-time service: </p>
<ul>
<li>The most obvious example is the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hourly-news-summary/id121493675?mt=2">NPR Hourly News Summary</a>. Here we have a really shrewd use of the feed, one that&#8217;s pegged to the hour and packaged in bite-sized pieces. You do get the sense that each package is dense with what you absolutely need to know at the top of a given hour. By the way, the feed occasionally pops up in the iTunes Top 200 Podcast Chart, for those interested in such things.</li>
<li>ICYMI, Serial <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/season-one/adnan-syeds-hearing">has been rolling out short daily updates</a> tracking the latest court hearing surrounding its season one subject, Adnan Syed. It&#8217;s absolutely fascinating, both in its substance and its structure, which is essentially Sarah Koenig giving a quick recap the development of the day.</li>
<li>The Serial mini-updates are reminiscent of a WBUR podcast that was rolled out last summer (with The Boston Globe) which tracked the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on an almost day-by-day basis. The podcast was called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/finish-line-inside-boston/id973345312?mt=2">Finish Line: Inside the Boston Bombing Marathon</a>, and it stretched the length of the trial. It was dense, sparsely composed, and utterly captivating in its specificities. These are reporters reporting, trading notes at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Gimlet&#8217;s Mix Week</strong>. The other most interesting bit of information that came out of the panel also happens to the one that&#8217;s most applicable to your organization, probably: This week, Gimlet is putting normal production operations on hold in favor of an internal exercise they&#8217;re calling Mix Week. &#8220;We&#8217;re breaking apart all the teams, they&#8217;re going to reform in new teams, and they&#8217;re going to be essentially given assignments for piloting,&#8221; Lieber explained. &#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a bunch of rules: No existing host can be the host of a pilot, pilots can only be hosted by non-hosts, and a bunch of other fun stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is to create an experimental space to better facilitate creative collaborations across shows, a dynamic that might find difficulty emerging when a workplace — even one developed for creative and editorial purposes — naturally slips into a configuration that feels like an assembly line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel like we have a lot of ideas burbling in the building, and when you&#8217;re in the churn of getting shows out every week, you don&#8217;t always have the time to come up and be tested,&#8221; said Lieber. </p>
<p>Gimlet&#8217;s Mix Week reminds me of stories about an internal competition that WNYC held a few years ago. Described to me as &#8220;an internal bake-off,&#8221; that event was led by <a href="http://current.org/2015/02/wnyc-loses-content-v-p-chris-bannon-to-podcasting-company-midroll/">Chris Bannon</a>, formerly WNYC&#8217;s VP of content development and production and now Midroll&#8217;s chief content officer, with support from a seven-person internal committee. The competition directly resulted in the creation of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/death-sex-money/id870688022?mt=2">Death, Sex, and Money</a> (all hail Anna Sale! Did you hear she&#8217;s moving to the West Coast?) and indirectly in the creation of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tldr/id709617583?mt=2">TLDR</a>, the <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/">On The Media</a> spinoff whose hosts would eventually go on to launch <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/">Reply All</a> at Gimlet. A source has told me that WNYC management sent out a note a few weeks ago announcing the return of the bake-off, which will now apparently take place every six months.</p>
<p>This is all a fine reminder of a simple fact: Magical things happen when you give the talented people you hire the opportunity to stretch their muscles, try different things, and prove themselves.</p>
<p><strong>The hosting platform holding up Serial.</strong> So I was surprised to learn last week that <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a>, the biggest and most downloaded podcast today — unless that&#8217;s changed over the past month, which I highly doubt — is not being hosted on <a href="https://www.podtrac.com/publisher">Podtrac</a>, which proudly put the show forward as a key client during the IAB&#8217;s Podcast Upfronts last year. Instead, ever since the start of the second season, the show has been hosted on an experimental new platform developed by <a href="http://www.prx.org/">PRX</a>, the friendly neighborhood public media company that&#8217;s also responsible for <a href="http://www.radiotopia.fm/">Radiotopia</a>, your friendly neighborhood hippie podcast commune. </p>
<p>The platform, which is called <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/publicradioexchange/dovetail_auto/">Dovetail</a> and also supports the Radiotopia podcast family, is supposedly designed for podcasts with extremely large audiences in mind, as PRX chief technology officer <a href="https://twitter.com/kookster">Andrew Kuklewicz</a> told me over email. Interestingly, the platform is built to distribute both podcasts <em>and</em> broadcasts, a curious distinction that firmly differentiates it from the bevy of other hosting platforms that I&#8217;ve covered so far. There&#8217;s a lot more to Dovetail, I&#8217;m told, and you can read the totality of Kuklewicz&#8217;s extremely enthusiastic (and understandably pluggy) email in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HoUsVly9ARROuvLHd60XUz-TS6P3N7q_HLCh3BIZZJ4/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Doc</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Public radio guidelines on podcast measurements.</strong> Last week, a group of North American public radio stations published a set of podcast measurement guidelines in a move to spur the industry to voluntarily adopt a standard. The publication was picked up by several publications — <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/02/public-radio-staffers-across-the-u-s-lay-out-new-guidelines-for-podcast-audience-measurement/">including Nieman Lab</a>, of course — and on Friday, I put out my own two cents in an extra Hot Pod newsletter. In a nutshell: the guidelines were published as part of a move to inject more life into conversation happening within the <a href="http://www.iab.net/">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a>, the industry association focused on digital media, which many major podcasting companies are hoping will serve as a reliable third-party arbiter of advertising standards in the emerging podcast industry.</p>
<p>You can read the extra newsletter, along with some pertinent reader responses, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KNialCbe3ZPFUMMUWeA-jWIi1TZ_dyAYYLxwPh6XKig/edit?usp=sharing">in this public Google Doc</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Google Play podcasts: They&#8217;re coming.</strong> Looks like you can&#8217;t have one streaming audio service without the other. Two weeks ago, Spotify indicated that <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/hot-pod-spotify-is-finally-ready-to-bring-podcasting-to-a-new-audience/">it would finally be rolling out its long-awaited podcast feature</a> (which, by the way, ended up being bundled together with video under an ecosystem labelled as &#8220;Shows&#8221;). According to its reported timeline, that rollout would have been completed across both iOS and Android platforms by the end of the last week. And now we&#8217;re hearing, perhaps accidentally, that Google Play Music&#8217;s own podcast rollout will take place by the end of February.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we know, and how we know it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Simmons, the sports media personality and proprietor of the Bill Simmons Podcast Network (BSPN), tweeted out last Tuesday that his podcast &#8220;will be available on Google Play when GP launches its podcast platform later this month.&#8221; Simmons deleted the tweet shortly after, suggesting that the information wasn&#8217;t all that public just yet. The tweet was captured <a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2016/02/02/bill-simmons-says-podcasts-are-coming-to-google-play-music-this-month/">via screenshot by Droid-Life</a>, an Android news site.</li>
<li>Parallel to this, several outlets — including <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/03/google-play-music-podcasts-show-up-for-some/">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/google-play-music-podcasts-are-live-for-some-users/">Ars Technica</a>, and <a href="http://9to5google.com/2016/02/03/google-play-podcasts-live/">9to5Google</a> — have noted that some Google Play Music users are already seeing the podcast feature being supported on their app.</li>
<li>TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/03/google-plays-podcast-platform-launch-appears-imminent/">has confirmed</a> that Google Play Music still has not officially launched podcast support, despite these podspottings.</li>
</ul>
<p>That some Google Play Music users are seeing podcast support ahead of an official launch is not unusual; feature-testing among a small sample of live users is common practice, especially for big platforms that need initial data from the wild before a wider rollout. </p>
<p>Anyway, three things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The various write-ups describing the app&#8217;s intended podcast features — which note the inclusion of, among other things, podcast charts, a &#8220;featured&#8221; section, and an open inclusion policy — Google Play Music sounds strikingly similar in both policy and practice to the native iOS Podcasts app. From this, I suspect that the thinking is to do precisely for the Android ecosystem what the native iOS Podcasts app does in the Apple ecosystem, which has so far been a relatively untapped market. This leaves open the question of what Spotify&#8217;s strategy will adopt to approach the space. They presumably shouldn&#8217;t play in the same lane as the iOS Podcasts app or Google Play Music, but what options are they left with?</li>
<li>That Google Play Music will have its own podcast charts is exciting. The iTunes podcast charts have long been obsessed over by podcast producers everywhere, given its status as one of the sole public determinants of a podcast&#8217;s success in relation to others, for both creators and, unfortunately, the uninitiated press. However, how exactly the iTunes charts evaluate podcasts, both individually and in relation to each other, has long been mysterious, and the inclusion of a Google alternative would theoretically help producers better approximate the relative value of their podcasts — and, secondarily, challenge Apple&#8217;s passive dominance as the main value-attributor in the podcasting space. As of this writing, it doesn&#8217;t look like Spotify has its own charts feature.</li>
<li>The central question when it comes to these audio streaming services remains: Will their entrance into the podcast space actually move the needle? While it&#8217;s still extremely early, a few podcasters I&#8217;ve spoken with suggest that they&#8217;ve seen some encouraging signs. (No specific details were provided, unfortunately.)</li>
</ul>

<li>I&#8217;ve really been digging <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06qcrhv"><em>Tumanbay</em></a>, an extravagantly produced 10-part audio drama published by BBC Radio 4. Reminiscent of <em>Game of Thrones</em> — in terms of subject matter and political allegory, but not in adult-oriented excesses (how would you do that in audio anyway? that market remains open!) — it&#8217;s utterly fun and almost completely not cringeworthy, which I largely attribute to a finely-tuned modulation of the vocal performances. Highly recommended. Also, hat tip to Slate&#8217;s June Thomas, a native Britisher of fine Britishisms, for the fabulous hashtag #TotallyTumanbay.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swipe to skip, swipe to like, swipe to share: these are the familiar smartphone motions that the BBC and a Kenyan startup called <a href="http://blog.ongair.im/">Ongair</a> are using in a mobile-focused website called <a href="http://bbc.com/drop">BBC Drop</a> that&#8217;s available for testing today. The project came out of a hackathon held by the BBC World Service and BBC Connected Studio (its digital R&#038;D arm) that invited African tech experts to generate ideas for reaching young, digital-savvy African audiences. It was designed last year in Nairobi and user-tested in several other countries in Africa. Users can try out and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/projects/bbc-drop-uk">rate the pilot for the next three months</a>.</p>
<p>The pilot is for Androids (which makes sense given <a href="http://qz.com/451844/africas-smartphone-market-is-on-the-rise-as-affordable-handsets-spur-growth/">Android&#8217;s dominance</a> in the African market), and relevant BBC content is filtered for users this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>BBC Drop asks the user for a few favorite topics, or social media preferences, and then continues to learn what they like and dislike from what they swipe on screen. There is also the option of an even more personal news feed which incorporates the user&#8217;s own social feeds. The end result is users getting to see content specifically tailored to them, and the stuff they are not interested in being filtered out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Content from all across the BBC feeds into the new Drop site. </p>
<p>The project is one of the BBC&#8217;s many <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world/africa/live">recent efforts</a> to reach audiences in Africa. BBC Connected Studio is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/connectedstudio/projects/growing-mobile-audiences-nigeria">currently seeking ideas</a> from teams in Nigeria for improving and broadening the reach of BBC content there (the deadline for submissions is next week).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your image of Mexico comes only from election rhetoric, you might think of it as a land of drug-pushing, crime-committing illegals aiming to upset all Americans hold dear. Well, it turns out Mexico is a market, not only for <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/mexico">American goods</a> of many kinds, but also for journalism. This election season, it is refreshing to see Mexico, and Latin America, in the news as something more than a piñata for ill-tempered politicians. (Net immigration is now back to Mexico from the U.S., <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/">says</a> Pew Research.)</p>
<p>Today, The New York Times does that news-making, launching an effort, a year in the making. Simply titled <a href="http://nytimes.com/es/">The New York Times en Español</a> — based in Mexico City and reaching out to all of Spanish-speaking Latin America — the Times&#8217; initial effort a modest one, but one intended both to be built out and to be used as a model for the Times in other parts of the world. It&#8217;s the Times&#8217; intention to launch a second region in 2016 as well. So, as the year begins, we can see the Times is clearly back in the new product game, with international expansion just part of the game plan — the rest TBA.</p>
<p>The potential audience is a big one — estimated by the Times at 80 million, including those who combine certain education and income levels with digital savvy. That&#8217;s out of about 500 million Spanish speakers worldwide, primarily in Latin America and Spain. While English is the de facto lingua franca worldwide, with 1 billion able to understand it, Spanish is not far behind.</p>
<p>The Times&#8217; immediate goal: get a little piece of that market to pay for a digital subscription to the Times. But it launches as a free product — no meter, no paywall, just ads from four launch sponsors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to stress that ultimately this is about a subscription model,&#8221; <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2013/10/8534646/iht-publisher-gets-promotion-international-new-york-times-debuts">Stephen Dunbar-Johnson</a>, the Times&#8217; international president, told me Friday. That&#8217;s consistent with what CEO Mark Thompson laid out in his <a href="http://newsonomics.com/what-are-they-thinking-mark-thompson-and-the-year-2020-challenge/">five-year plan</a>. Reader revenue — now running at <a href="http://investors.nytco.com/investors/investor-news/investor-news-details/2016/The-New-York-Times-Company-Reports-2015-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx">53 percent of total revenue</a> for the Times — is the lead dog going forward. Readers like you and me are far more loyal to the Times than are advertisers, as the worlds of advertising continue to experience one upheaval after another. (Just one example from last week&#8217;s Times&#8217; <a href="http://investors.nytco.com/investors/investor-news/investor-news-details/2016/The-New-York-Times-Company-Reports-2015-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx">Q4 financial report</a>: Its print revenue month-by-month in that quarter was -9 percent, 0 percent and +7 percent.)</p>
<p>Further, the Times is still on a digital subscription roll. It can claim almost 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, up 20 percent year over year and a net gain of 53,000 subscribers in the last quarter. Thompson said Thursday that the Times believes it will hit 1.25 million by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Of that number, perhaps NYT en Español will contribute somewhere in the five figures — at some point. The Times now has sold more than 100,000 digital-only subscriptions (12-13 percent of its overall total) to those living outside the U.S. The Times won&#8217;t break out that geography, but we can safely assume the great bulk are subscribers in Europe and Canada. Whatever the Times can eke out of its new market in 2017 — <em>if</em> it launches any metered paywall system by then — will be just a down payment on 2018-20 plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not plan on having a pay system in 2016,&#8221; says Dunbar-Johnson. &#8220;We have a lot to learn from our Latin American readers, and we need to understand their needs and preferences. As we do, and over time, we will find the solutions to best engage them and, in turn, develop a subscription relationship. All to say, this is a long-term audience development road&#8230;In markets where we have yet to achieve significant penetration, we are focusing first on audience growth supported by advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times hopes to cook up a new audience. Says Dunbar-Johnson: &#8220;We want to take a bet on exposing larger numbers of people in this market in Spanish to New York Times journalism. Have them marinate in the brand.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Learning from the 2014 Times&#8217; paid experiments</h3>
<p>In his comments, you can hear the lessons of 2014 at the Times. That spring, it announced plans for three subscription paid products. The millennial-oriented, lower-priced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/nytnow/">NYT Now</a> launched, but couldn&#8217;t land more than 20,000 subscribers; it remains today as a free product and a good learning lab for the Times. <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/10/a-mixed-bag-on-apps-what-the-new-york-times-learned-with-nyt-opinion-and-nyt-now/">NYT Opinion</a> launched, but it became immediately apparent that it, too, wouldn&#8217;t find much of an additional paying market; it was closed within six months. <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a> lives on, popular with readers but relying only on ads, the Times having decided against putting in a metered pay system, given what it had learned. Those echoes of product testing informed much of the Times&#8217; new product development work of 2015. So, with the new products — and NYT en Español will be only the first to launch this year, details to come — the model is develop the audience first, charge later.</p>
<p>The relative modesty of today&#8217;s launch is a contrast to earlier efforts. Those 2014 launches were costly, as has been its foray in China. In this case, we see a total cost of probably $2 million or so to build out the first in-language regional product. Given, though, the newly built-out central team — which will lead development in the other non-U.S. regions — the marginal cost of new regions should come at less than $1 million each. That incremental cost will be driven by the size and experience of editorial staff needed to create a winning product.</p>
<p>We can see another reason for the Times&#8217; caution here: Expanding outside a publisher&#8217;s home market is anything but easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re introducing the Times to a new group of people,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulwalborsky">Paul Walborsky</a>, the business head of the Times&#8217; new international product efforts and of NYT en Español. Walborsky, who serves as a strategic consultant to the Times, brings unusual experience to the company. He is an entrepreneur steeped in publishing, with broad and fundamental knowledge of Latin America. He was born and raised in Mexico City, leaving at age 19, but has kept up connections in the region. He brings to the Times a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulwalborsky">long background</a> in both startups (selling the financial CRM WorldStreet Corp to Thomson Financial in 2002), and in finance and tech. In the digital news business, he&#8217;s known as the guy who built Gigaom for seven years, leaving as its CEO 18 months ago, some nine months <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/14/the-long-story-behind-gigaoms-sudden-demise/">before the site collapsed</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/lydia_polgreen/index.html">Lydia Polgreen</a> matches Walborsky&#8217;s passion for the region. A highly regarded international correspondent, with wide-ranging experience in South Africa, south Asia and west Africa, her 14-year Times career has led to the development of NYT en Español. (&#8220;I&#8217;m still working on my Spanish.&#8221; How&#8217;s it coming? &#8220;Muy bien,&#8221; she laughs.)</p>
<p>As part of her duties as deputy international editor, she will direct a team of six journalists, based in Mexico City and headed by Times editor (and native Venezuelan) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/whos-who">Eli Lopez</a>. Importantly, the first staff has broad geographic roots, including representation from Spain, Venezuela, and Colombia. They will produce original stories, aided by a half-dozen current Times correspondents in the region. In addition, the product will feature 10-15 daily Times stories (of the 150 produced daily in English) translated into Spanish. While based in Mexico City, the world&#8217;s largest Spanish-speaking city, the intention is to serve everyone in Latin America (save those Portuguese-speaking Brazilians, who actually slightly outnumber all the continent&#8217;s Spanish speakers).</p>
<p>Reader research showed a high interest in a Times-curated news product. That research has been multi-faceted, including street intercepts of would-be readers, use of Facebook as a platform, and even sending out test newsletter products. Importantly, the Times&#8217; initial product team includes one data scientist and one person dedicating to user design research, testimony to how important the new research and analytics are to contemporary product development.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new circle of knowledge, as Walborsky describes it: &#8220;market research, user design research, and then we validate with data science.&#8221;</p>
<p>He uses the word <em>narrowcasting</em>. &#8220;By using fairly advanced data science, we can actually get to the right audience and get them engaged. At the end of the day, you can&#8217;t just spend money, because you can&#8217;t translate everything, and you cannot produce 500 pieces. You really need to narrowcast, or narrow-target, your content to the right audience.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Engagement is the key</h3>
<p>Now it&#8217;s out of the data and into the marketplace. Importantly, in this case it isn&#8217;t the top of the proverbial <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_94.htm">audience funnel</a> that&#8217;s most important. It&#8217;s the middle — those that can be regularly engaged in Times content.</p>
<p>Says Polgreen: &#8220;Our goal is to skip the mass audience step. If we get 50 million people coming to this website, that will be great, but I think our real target is to try and go out there to find who are the most engaged users who we think are going to want to come to use a couple of times a week, or every day, and really have a deeply engaged relationship with The New York Times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consequently, how many stories people read is one test here. I&#8217;d believe that paying subscribers would one day expect many more, but that&#8217;s a decision for down the road.</p>
<p>In offering a once-a-week newsletter, <a href="http://nytimes.com/es/">Boletin</a>, at launch, the Times applies a lesson from the mothership. Email newsletters, briefings, and alerts all increase engagement, and the Times is engaging more resources to work each format. By spring, Boletin is planned to go to five days a week.</p>
<p>NYT en Español is browser-only; no app is planned at this point. It looks much like the rest of the Times&#8217; site. Ultimately, the desired engagement may depend as much on the intangible of product feel, as its content. That&#8217;s a question of <em>la voz</em>, the voice of this product that the Times hopes to make a friendly and comfortable daily companion of the most engaged (and eventually paying) readers.</p>
<p>The half-dozen editorial staffers are matched up with an equal number of those directing and aiding the product, including product manager, data scientist, user design researcher, and developer.</p>
<p>We can expect the Times to launch a variety of marketing programs over the year. I asked whether it has been able to secure any launch help from one of its major investors, Carlos Slim, who owns 16.8 percent of the Times after making a major investment in the depths of the Great Recession. Slim, edged out by $2 billion by Bill Gates for the No. 1 spot on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">Forbes&#8217; wealth list</a>, owns <a href="http://www.americamovil.com/">América Móvil</a>, the largest mobile carrier in Latin America. I wondered if Slim could help the Times with product placement or preferences in ways similar to those that Samsung has done with Axel Springer, <a href="http://newsonomics.com/upday-ups-the-ante-on-mobile-news-aggregation/">as the German media company launches</a> its mobile news aggregator product, Upday.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says Polgreen. &#8220;As you know, Carlos Slim is an investor in the Times, just like any other. He&#8217;s not involved in the project in any way.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Four launch sponsors defray the investment</h3>
<p>While subscription may be the longer-term goal here, for now it&#8217;s advertising that will help defray the cost of the 12-person investment the Times is making.</p>
<p>The New York Times en Español launches with four initial, three-month sponsors, a good representation. Interestingly, they&#8217;re a mix of U.S. advertisers wanting to reach a broader market and Latin American-based corporations.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at Latin America, you certainly have a pool of potential advertisers of those that are pan-Latin,&#8221; says Dunbar-Johnson. &#8220;These are companies that are multinationals that have significant interest in Latin America; there are a reasonable number of those.&#8221; Those sponsors include a financial giant, Mexico&#8217;s Banamex, Formula 1 Gran Premio de Mexico 2016, and Acciona, a large Spanish renewable energy company.</p>
<p>The Times begins this initiative with no staffed advertising sales offices in the region (it has long had New York Times Syndicate sales staff there), but it does have an agent in Mexico City, and plans to build out its own sales staff as the audience grows.</p>
<p>Will the Times&#8217; T Brand Studio, its big digital-ad growth engine, be spinning out branded content ads in the new product? Not yet, but its talent could kick in as the audience grows to scale.</p>
<p>As it enters the new marketplace, there&#8217;s lot of competition. Primary, of course, is the the contest for readers&#8217; time. Then, there are other publishers.</p>
<p>Latin American media revived itself after the dark years of dictatorship and censorship that marked much of the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. Mostly family-owned, the in-country press has more lately suffered from the same kinds of digital disruption that have affected North America and Europe. Their depth of non-national reporting varies, and only a few have any original global staffing. We&#8217;d also have to consider <a href="http://elpais.com/">El País</a>, the Madrid-based daily with extensive operations in Latin America, BBC Mundo, CNN en Español and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/public/page/espanol-inicio.html">The Wall Street Journal</a> as competition.</p>
<p>Both the Times (<a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/the-newsonomics-of-the-new-york-times-expanding-global-strategy/">&#8220;The newsonomics of The New York Times&#8217; expanding global strategy&#8221;</a>) and the Journal have had their share of stumbles abroad; the Times abandoned a Brazil edition when it ran into headwinds three years ago. Even as The Guardian, Quartz, BuzzFeed, and The Huffington Post build and plan sites far afield, it&#8217;s clear not all of them will succeed. As both Bloomberg and the Financial Times, both more highly experienced in global publishing, have found, it&#8217;s a long slog of building ad relationships, relevance, and readership. The Times&#8217; investment here, then, can be seen as a relatively small one that can be sustained and allowed time to find traction. That&#8217;s the hope, anyway, for a new product that stands as one of the first of 2016.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iowa caucuses are confusing. Every four years, Americans receive a crash course in the quirky midwestern custom that kicks off the presidential nominating cycle, but for news consumers abroad — even those who follow U.S. politics — the process can be even more mystifying. </p>
<p>So before Iowans caucused last week, The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/universal/es/iowa-primaria-elecciones-estados-unidos-trump-clinton.html">published a story in Spanish</a> to explain how the caucuses work and what their impact will be on the rest of the campaign. </p>
<p>The story was written by journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/albinsonl">Albinson Linares</a> for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/es">The New York Times en Español</a>, a Spanish-language site the Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/es/2016/02/07/un-saludo-de-nuestra-editora/">officially launching today</a>. The site, to be run out of Mexico City, will curate and translate 10 to 15 Times news and opinion articles each day while also featuring some original Spanish-language reporting. The site is one of the latest steps in a larger effort from the paper to grow its international audience. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/01_HomePage_NYTES-1.png" alt="01_HomePage_NYTES" width="700" height="619" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This team, and future teams that we build in other places, can be a bridge — not just to bring Times journalism to those places, but also to explain the United States and all the things that happen here to those audiences,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolgreen/">Lydia Polgreen</a>, the deputy international editor who oversaw editorial development of the project told me.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elopez_nyc">Elias Lopez</a> is the site&#8217;s editorial director, and he&#8217;ll be working with a team of six journalists.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>International expansion has long been one of the Times&#8217; goals. In a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/4-takeaways-from-the-new-york-times-new-digital-strategy-memo/">memo last year</a>, CEO Mark Thompson and executive editor Dean Baquet wrote that the paper would prioritize efforts “to tailor our journalism and products to make them more relevant for specific new audiences, rather than viewing the rest of the world as just one big audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times began translating stories into Spanish in <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/02/the-new-york-times-en-espanol-an-experiment-is-putting-times-stories-in-front-of-spanish-speaking-readers/">early 2015</a> as it worked to develop the new products. The project was based out of NYT Beta, an in-house incubator of sorts that also originated apps like NYT Cooking and NYT Now.</p>
<p>In addition to the site that the Times is debuting today, it&#8217;s also launching a twice-weekly newsletter, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/membercenter/boletin-newsletter-signup.html?_r=1">Boletín</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/NYTSpanishNewsletter.jpg" alt="NYTSpanishNewsletter" width="600" height="362" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll be exploring different models as time goes on,&#8221; Polgreen said. &#8220;This is a beta project. We&#8217;re learning. We&#8217;re trying to understand the audience. We&#8217;re trying to understand the value.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Times decided to focus on a Spanish product first because the language is so widely spoken (a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/30/chart-there-are-more-spanish-speakers-in-the-u-s-than-spain/">Spanish government report</a> last year estimated that there are 559 million Spanish speakers globally, including 470 million native speakers). That many Spanish-speaking countries are near the United States meant the staff didn&#8217;t have to battle time zones or travel far to conduct research.</p>
<p>The paper expects its largest audiences for the new product to come from Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Spain. There is also a sizable audience of Spanish speakers in the United States.</p>
<p>Polgreen wouldn&#8217;t specify which other regions the Times is targeting for future expansion, but she said the paper would probably try to replicate the curated approach even if it&#8217;s entering a predominantly English-speaking market.</p>
<p>For now, the Spanish site will be free to access, and its stories won&#8217;t count against the Times&#8217; paywall. Polgreen said the Times plans to continue to &#8220;experiment with a lot of different potential models, paid and not&#8221; as it grows internationally. &#8220;Our main goal in this is to get people to think of The New York Times as an important part of their daily lives,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Times has had a mixed record with previous attempts at international growth. In 2012, it debuted a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/asia/china-blocks-web-access-to-new-york-times.html">Chinese-language site</a> that was promptly blocked by the Chinese government. Last year, it began posting on <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/the-new-york-times-is-targeting-new-readers-in-asia-through-wechat/">WeChat</a> in English and Chinese. Plans for a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/10/on-the-road-to-sao-paulo-why-the-new-york-times-sees-opportunity-in-brazil/">Portuguese-language site</a>, however, were scrapped, and the Times also <a href="http://observer.com/2014/07/the-new-york-times-shuts-india-ink-blog/">shuttered its India Ink blog</a> in 2014. </p>
<p>Looking abroad for growth has become a common move for U.S. and U.K. outlets. The Guardian has launched newsrooms in the United States and Australia; <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/02/the-sun-never-sets-on-the-times-how-and-why-the-british-paper-built-its-new-weekly-international-app/">The Times of London</a> recently launched an app specifically for international audiences. And organizations such as BuzzFeed and Mashable have also expanded abroad.</p>
<p>Polgreen said she considers The New York Times en Español an extension of the Times&#8217; current products. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a separate brand for it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The truth is, people want to read The New York Times, and they want to read the Times&#8217; marquee journalists. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s most appealing to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polgreen has led the editorial side of the project. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulwalborsky">Paul Walborsky</a>, the former Gigaom CEO who has been consulting for the Times since late 2014, worked on the business side. Polgreen said she and Walborsky were &#8220;joined at the hip&#8221; throughout the process. Others on the team worked on design, product development, and data science. </p>
<p>Over the past year or so, Polgreen and others have taken multiple trips to the region to conduct research on the market. On one, Polgreen walked around Mexico City getting her shoes shined at multiple places, and asking the shoeshiners how their customers typically consume their news. Polgreen learned that before work in the mornings, people tended to read hard news on their phones. After lunch, they moved to one of the many Mexican celebrity tabloids. Team members also commuted with people on the subway to understand how they use their phones to consume news.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a foreign correspondent for ten years,&#8221; Polgreen said. &#8220;I’ve always had the instinct to go out and talk to people, but it was really interesting to take that approach and apply it to developing a product.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have been to Mexico City five times in the last year. I fall a little more in love with every visit. <a href="https://t.co/IaKqR53qyi">https://t.co/IaKqR53qyi</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lydia Polgreen (@lpolgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolgreen/status/685129135128231936">January 7, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Times also ran tests on Facebook and elsewhere to learn which types of stories resonated most with Spanish-speaking audiences, and which were better received in English. That data helped the Times determine the kinds of stories it wanted to translate and highlight in Spanish.</p>
<p>Because the Times wants to reach users through the Spanish-speaking world in Latin America as well as Spain, the team of journalists in Mexico City running the project are all native Spanish speakers who hail from around Latin America and Spain. Times staffers in New York and the Times&#8217; correspondents throughout Latin America will also contribute to the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to have a staff that crossed the Spanish-speaking world because our hope was to come up with a tone and a language that would be accessible to everyone,&#8221; Polgreen said. &#8220;We have a group of people who can talk together and say, &#8216;This word means this in Mexico, but does it sound different to a Colombian ear?&#8217; Having that real-time back-and-forth ensures that we&#8217;re getting high-quality translations and using as neutral a Spanish as possible,&#8221; Polgreen said.</p>
<p>For now, the team will focus primarily on translated stories, but Polgreen said the Times could pursue more original Spanish stories if the demand from readers is there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting with a largely translated project with a significant component of original reporting, but as we build an audience, as we understand the needs of that audience, we can make deeper investments in original reporting based on what we learn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to backload rather than front load these investments.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want more election coverage right in your company&#8217;s Slack? On Friday, The New York Times rolled out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/politics/election-bot.html">NYT Election Bot</a>, which anyone can add to their Slack channel to receive &#8220;live results and updates on the 2016 elections from The New York Times. You can also submit questions to the newsroom by using the command /asknytelection.&#8221;</p>
We were also looking what we had done in past cycles with live Q&#038;A&#8217;s during debates, where you would type your question into a form that was part of our liveblog page. We are trying to see how something like this would connect with readers more where they’re at. Certain types of people are already using Slack to chat with their friends. Quartz just had that <a href="http://qz.com/609522/my-family-of-four-uses-slack-and-now-we-cant-imagine-life-without-it/">piece about using Slack to manage communication with family</a>. This is us looking at Slack in a much broader way: Between Slack and Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, there&#8217;s increasing use of these types of tools in daily life in ongoing, permanent ways. So what does it mean for the Times to have a presence in those arenas as well?</p>
<p>The question we’re still getting our heads around is: What is useful to a person or a group of people who have their own room and are talking about things, like a debate or primary or caucus, who would benefit from some amount of automation from the bot, but also some kind of human-like integration? And how could that be two-way?</p>
<p>We also have to figure out what the reporters have time to do. How can they participate alongside all of the other things they’re doing in unfolding news situations, like when returns are coming in on a primary night? Can [a Slack bot like this] be useful and time-saving in some way, or is it just another thing they&#8217;re trying to juggle? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been grappling with lately.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t crystallized what we’re committing to, and we haven&#8217;t decided how to present the value of this to readers. We&#8217;re just practicing a bit in public. We&#8217;re having friends and family install the bot, and having them think through what they&#8217;d want this to do, if they have the TV on and are following our coverage and other people&#8217;s coverage.</div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the fact that it&#8217;s a bot. Another place where the graphics desk has played around with bots and bot personality is with the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/faster-stronger-and-with-better-kickers-the-new-york-times-4th-down-bot-gets-an-upgrade/">4th Down Bot</a>. A lot of the tweets were human-written at first, and it&#8217;s become more automated over time, but we&#8217;re trying to sort out that dimension.</p>
<p>Does it makes sense to have results come in on a regular basis, the way you get traffic on the eights? Or should it be when there is some sort of major update that actually is more relevant? The first feels more bot-like, the second feels more human-like. We&#8217;re still at the very early stages of figuring out how to strike that balance.</p>
<p>Also, the people who are willing to even be chatting about something like a primary or caucus night on Slack are a little more of an insider audience. We&#8217;re using this as a way to explore the idea for much larger events later in the year.</div></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>January was a good month for The Conversation U.S. (TCUS), the American edition of the nonprofit site first launched in Australia as a platform seeking to offer in-depth, reliable takes on the news cycle.</p>
<p>TCUS saw 540,000 unique visitors to its main site last month, but because all of its pieces are published under a Creative Commons license and thus can be freely republished at other outlets, it&#8217;s reached an audience of 5.5 million. (For instance, <a href="https://theconversation.com/woody-guthrie-old-man-trump-and-a-real-estate-empires-racist-foundations-53026">this piece</a> on Woody Guthrie and Donald Trump&#8217;s father was republished on The Huffington Post, Newsweek, and other sites.)</p>
<p>The Conversation U.S. also recently announced <a href="https://theconversation.com/introducing-the-conversation-us-founding-university-partners-53598">19 public and private research universities</a> across the U.S. as its &#8220;founding partners.&#8221; These new member universities pay a yearly fee and get access to a comprehensive analytics dashboard that details the reach of a story written by someone affiliated with that university. Smaller universities on the founding partners list pay $20,000 a year, and the larger research universities pay $35,000. Boston University, which has been supporting TCUS since its launch in 2014 by <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2014/the-conversation-comes-to-the-united-states-via-bu/">providing office space</a> to an initial team of nine staffers, is now an official paying partner.</p>
<p>Since The Conversation&#8217;s editorial strategy relies on daily call-outs to institutions across the U.S., direct pitches from the schools themselves, and commissioning, will this university membership system inevitably show preference to coverage of research coming out of those 19 founding partner universities, or to pieces authored by faculty at those schools?</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is, we&#8217;re an editorially independent publication, we have a <a href="https://theconversation.com/us/charter">charter that outlines how we operate and our procedures</a>, and our editing is independent, so every decision we make is made from that perspective,&#8221; The Conversation’s U.S. managing editor <a href="https://twitter.com/mariabalinska">Maria Balinska</a> said. &#8220;But as with any partnership, you’re going to be developing a relationship, getting a sense of what’s going on at the universities we’re partnering with, getting a sense of what kinds of research they’re doing. We’re going to be able to have a front seat at what they’re investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, the overall editorial process will remain the same — pitching, call-outs, and commissioned pieces — and that the editors will have a &#8220;special relationship and a close one&#8221; to the 19 new founding partners, but will continue to work with other universities, too. </p>
<p>The Conversation team has moved to a new coworking office space in downtown Boston, and received a new infusion of foundation money through the <a href="http://www.ritaallenfoundation.org/">Rita Allen Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/">Simons Foundation</a>, and the Knight Foundation (Knight is also a supporter of Nieman Lab). </p>
<p>A <a href="http://knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/9/15/conversation-us-bridges-gap-between-universities-and-local-communities-compelling-content/">$120,000 grant from Knight</a> is supporting dissemination of The Conversation&#8217;s content to local and regional media through a pilot with Community Newspaper Holdings. A project manager is on board to explore how The Conversation&#8217;s content might work best in CNHI papers across the country.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-700x334.png" alt="Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump" width="700" height="334" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120953" srcset="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-700x334.png 700w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-768x367.png 768w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-990x473.png 990w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-260x124.png 260w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-360x172.png 360w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-480x229.png 480w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-600x286.png 600w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-320x153.png 320w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-640x306.png 640w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump-1280x611.png 1280w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Conversation-screenshot-donald-trump.png 1479w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The new influx of funding is going toward hiring new editors to help expand the site&#8217;s coverage, particularly in the areas of science, health, and medicine, and politics and society (given the fervor of the 2016 campaign, a much-needed hire). Now, TCUS is looking to build out its own little bureau in the South by hiring a couple of editors based in Atlanta (Georgia State University, one of the founding partners, has offered space). The donated space is a plus, Balinska said, but Atlanta is also an interesting hub.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a combination of things: The CDC is headquartered down there, there&#8217;s Georgia State&#8217;s School of Public Health, there&#8217;s the Morehouse School of Medicine, there&#8217;s Emory,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There’s a real concentration of work in that area. Atlanta is also a really interesting anchor politically. We felt that having someone in the South, who would still be working with universities across the country but would commission stories sitting in a different place, was an important perspective to have.&#8221;</p>
<p>TCUS may also be looking westward: At the moment, it&#8217;s figuring out space for an editor based in the Bay Area (conveniently, the University of California is another founding partner), TCUS director of university relations and development Bruce G. Wilson said. When we spoke last summer, Wilson was more cautious about the organization&#8217;s reliance on foundation money, but with additional grants coming in and continued foundation interest, &#8220;now we see ourselves in the long term being a foundation and university-funded operation.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>News analysis program <a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/">On Point</a> is one of Boston public radio station WBUR&#8217;s most popular and prominent shows, yet <a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/">its website</a> looks more than a little outdated and isn&#8217;t mobile-friendly. It&#8217;s hard to figure out where content from the show lives when visiting the <a href="http://www.wbur.org/">main wbur.org website</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/old-onpoint-phone-screenshot.jpg" alt="old-onpoint-phone-screenshot" width="250" height="auto" class="nakedleftimage" /></p>
<p>So the website is getting an overhaul. &#8220;We&#8217;re planning to make audio more of a first-class citizen online,&#8221; WBUR&#8217;s executive editor for digital <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffanycampbell">Tiffany Campbell</a> told me, &#8220;while also making sure the design can honor the stuff we do in visuals and text.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://beta.wbur.org">website overhaul</a>, WBUR hopes to address challenges around the station&#8217;s online presence and its underlying structure. For listeners, there&#8217;s the problem of seamless listening and of discovery — I missed my top local headlines this morning and want to catch up. Or, I see an audio player for a long segment but don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll be interesting — how do I listen without disrupting my browsing experience entirely?</p>
<p>Different show pages had different requirements for presenting text stories, audio, and relevant art. Without any in-house design resources, the work of maintaining and debugging all these separate WordPress verticals inevitably falls to a pair of in-house developers.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/WBUR-classic-screenshot-700x421.png" alt="WBUR-classic-screenshot" width="700" height="421" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>As the station began considering a large-scale redesign of its website and infrastructure, other problems surfaced. Some required technical solutions: The station&#8217;s livestream, for instance, lived on <a href="http://www.wbur.org/listen/live">its own separate page</a>; click on &#8220;full schedule&#8221; to see what&#8217;s coming up on air, and you&#8217;re taken <em>away</em> from the player. Pieces of the site were responsive, but the station didn&#8217;t have a consistent mobile strategy. Other problems required a rethinking of how a local public radio station should maintain its relationship with its audience: Why weren&#8217;t there more digital offerings for listeners to engage with?</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a high number of high-level goals, and we weren&#8217;t sure how to tackle all of them,&#8221; said <a href="http://www.wbur.org/about/people/william-smith">William Smith</a>, a WBUR developer. &#8220;As a public radio station we dip our toes into a number of different areas, and these new front-facing websites kept creeping up. The technical debts and costs of trying to keep them all up reached a boiling point.&#8221; </p>
<p>The beta (<a href="http://beta.wbur.org/beta-feedback">emphasis on beta</a>, Campbell cautioned) version of the new WBUR.org is fully responsive and features a persistent player, so users can browse while listening. They can choose show segments and jump back and forth between the livestream and segments seamlessly; once they reach the end of a show segment, the audio player automatically jumps to the livestream. An &#8220;Explore Audio&#8221; section features all the latest audio content, and down the line visitors will be able to create their own segment playlists. The team is also working on a new mobile app, to be released later this year.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/new-onpoint-phone-screenshot.jpg" alt="new-onpoint-phone-screenshot" width="250" height="auto" class="nakedleftimage" /></p>
<p>To make the best of WBUR&#8217;s two-developers-to-dozens-of-staffers ratio, the new site is built to be modular, so that producers will be able to choose from a menu of web components that suit the needs of whichever story page they&#8217;re putting up. Some WBUR-maintained subsections, like arts vertical <a href="http://artery.wbur.org/">The Artery</a> and opinion page <a href="http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/">Cognoscenti</a>, don&#8217;t have regular audio segments. Others, like On Point, need to be able to highlight a couple of hours of audio.</p>
<p>The redesign began about two years ago. After an extensive period of gathering data on what people liked and what they wanted and then shopping around for a design firm (since the station has no designers on staff), WBUR contracted with the Boston-based company <a href="http://upstatement.com/portfolio/">Upstatement</a>. The team at Upstatement handled the visual branding and design.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/WBUR-new-site-programs-logos-700x447.png" alt="WBUR-new-site-programs-logos" width="700" height="447" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>Smith and another developer, Forrest Marvez (who has since left WBUR), were embedded at the Upstatement offices last summer, where they constructed the API, learned React.js, and started building the new site full-time around June. Much of the invisible work over the past months has gone into rebuilding an <a href="http://www.npr.org/api/index">audio API</a> so that NPR, WBUR, and other audio content could be made available in one central location. The station has brought on an NPR developer <a href="http://crookednumber.com/">David Moore</a> to continue the work on the API front and refining curation tools that will allow editorial staff the freedom to put together a section page by hand when needed or let the pages populate automatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first spoke, John [<a href="http://www.wbur.org/about/people/john-davidow">Davidow, WBUR executive editor</a>] and Tiffany told us, &#8216;We want this awesome audio experience, but we don&#8217;t necessarily know what that awesome experience looks like,'&#8221; designer-developer and partner at Upstatement <a href="https://twitter.com/jarednova">Jared Novack</a> said. &#8220;So we started with smaller projects around article pages, redesigning those, making them mobile-friendly, introducing new conventions. Then we started to understand what &#8216;awesome audio&#8217; meant to WBUR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted whatever they could work out for us to be extensible, capable of being improved upon,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p>Plenty of complex work remains to whip the beta into more than minimal-viable-product shape. WBUR is <a href="https://www.wbur.org/about/blog/2015/12/08/wbur-seeking-developer-to-join-growing-team-in-boston">hiring another developer</a> to shoulder the technical burden.</p>
<p>Stories are being migrated in real time to the beta site but are also available on the old WBUR site. As beta users provide feedback, both sites will stay up and running for an unspecified amount of time.</p>
<p>Other elements of the new site will get more sophisticated over time as the developers continue their work and user feedback rolls in. Suggested next stories at the bottom of each story page to encourage people to spend more time on the site, for instance, could become more dynamic and personalized.</p>
<p>The team is also still working on better ways for the site to handle underwriting (ads) and member donations. Thirty to forty percent of WBUR&#8217;s current web traffic comes through social, and often when a story goes viral elsewhere, the story&#8217;s public radio origins are lost. There might be ways to make it clearer to readers that the story came from a nonprofit, member-serving organization, Campbell pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to be really disciplined about not calling this process just a redesign,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve built a brand new platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much has been solved for visuals and text. When we set out to look for what would be a great model for audio, we only really have models in music — Pandora and Spotify — but spoken word is not the same. We&#8217;re trying to figure out what will work.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.si.com/">Sports Illustrated</a> is releasing a new app Thursday that emphasizes video and prioritizes SI&#8217;s stable of well-known writers over scores and other real-time information.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/SI_App_1.jpeg" alt="SI_App_1" width="300" height="534" class="nakedrightimage" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" />After users open a video in the SI app, they can scroll down and the video minimizes into the top left-hand corner of the screen. They can then continue to explore other sections of the app. When they&#8217;re done watching, they drag the video into into the middle of the screen to make it disappear. </p>
<p>&#8220;Video is one of the highest priorities we have,&#8221; Sports Illustrated Group editor-in-chief <a href="https://twitter.com/Fichtenbaum_SI">Paul Fichtenbaum</a> told me. &#8220;We wanted it fully baked into every channel on the app.&#8221; </p>
<p>In 2014, the magazine launched <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/sports-illustrated-si-wire-make-dozens-videos-daily/294864/">SI Wire</a>, which is made up of 30- to 60-second news videos, and it recently added Mustard Minute, a similarly formatted video series for Extra Mustard, SI&#8217;s lifestyle and comedy section.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s what sponsors are looking for,&#8221; Fichtenbaum said, regarding video. &#8220;That’s what our audience is looking for, more importantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of other publications, such as The Washington Post and CNN, have added a similar feature onto their websites. The YouTube app also lets users shrink the video into a corner and continue browsing.</p>
<p>In addition to letting users multitask, this approach to video makes it easier for publishers to track video views for advertisers.</p>
<p>The sports app landscape is highly competitive. ESPN, Yahoo Sports, and several league-run apps are all featured in Apple&#8217;s Essential Apps collection. Last month, Facebook launched <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/01/facebook-sports-stadium/">Sports Stadium</a>, a section dedicated to live sports coverage. SI hopes its name-brand writers and editorially focused approach help separate it from other apps. (It&#8217;s not an accident that the scoreboard tab is the farthest to the right on the app.) </p>
<p>&#8220;Our writers are a differentiator for us,&#8221; Fichtenbaum said. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/SI_App2.jpeg" alt="SI_App2" width="300" height="534" class="nakedleftimage" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" />The new app&#8217;s homepage is a personalized feed of stories based on the writers and teams that users choose to follow. Another new feature is &#8220;10 Spot,&#8221; a tab that features 10 trending stories chosen by the app&#8217;s editors, including some culture and lifestyle coverage. (The 10 Spot tab follows a trend toward finishable products, as outlets from <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/08/how-the-skimms-passionate-readership-helped-its-newsletter-grow-to-1-5-million-subscribers/">The Skimm</a>, with its daily newsletter, to The Economist, with its <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/the-economists-tom-standage-on-digital-strategy-and-the-limits-of-a-model-based-on-advertising/">Espresso app,</a> have tried to move away from the overwhelming, never-ending story stream.)</p>
<p>The SI app also includes a more general news feed that is sortable by sport, and a separate scoreboard. Individual scoreboards can be pinned throughout the app, so you can keep tabs on the Celtics-Pistons score while also reading <a href="https://twitter.com/SI_PeterKing">Peter King&#8217;s</a> latest dispatch from the Super Bowl. </p>
<p>Users can  choose to receive notifications for individual games and specific writers they&#8217;re interested in, so every time<a href="http://www.si.com/author/tom-verducci"> Tom Verducci</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/GrantWahl">Grant Wahl</a> posts a new story they&#8217;ll get a push notification. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated launched its <a href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/media/4162.html">iPhone app in 2009</a>, but that ultimately evolved into an app featuring digital editions of the weekly magazine as SI decided to focus its mobile resources elsewhere. In 2014, after SI and other Time Inc. publications spun off from Time Warner, the magazine introduced a <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/sports-illustrated-relaunching-site-mobile/">redesigned responsive website</a>.</p>
<p>SI is just the latest publisher to renew its focus on apps even as social platforms like Facebook take on outsized importance in connecting readers with content. The <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/02/the-sun-never-sets-on-the-times-how-and-why-the-british-paper-built-its-new-weekly-international-app/">Times of London</a> just released an app directed at an international audience, and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/quartz-sees-its-readers-behaviors-evolving-so-its-evolving-with-them-its-launching-its-first-major-app/">Quartz plans</a> to launch its first news app this year. The Wall Street Journal is <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/wall-street-journals-apps-take-laser-focus/">reportedly planning</a> a series of new apps. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated is also releasing a new Swimsuit app to coincide with the release of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8QNDRbjong">oft-criticized but high-selling</a> Swimsuit Issue later this month, Fichtenbaum said.</p>
<p>A couple of newly relevant benefits of apps are that they offer paths around <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/the-mobile-ad-blocking-apocalypse-hasnt-arrived-at-least-not-yet/">mobile adblockers</a> (the SI app has display ads throughout, plus pre-roll video ads) and enable the use of push notifications.</p>
<p>Quartz, for example, purposefully eschewed an app when it launched in 2012 because it wanted to reduce barriers between readers and content, but now that it&#8217;s more well-known, an app became a more attractive strategy, publisher <a href="https://twitter.com/jlauf">Jay Lauf</a> told me last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that changes the landscape with apps is notifications,&#8221; Lauf said. &#8220;Notifications are an increasingly popular mechanism for staying abreast of news and information and staying connected with brands. Apps certainly give you the opportunity for that.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/PewElection1.jpg" alt="PewElection1" width="300" height="502" class="nakedrightimage" />More than 90 percent of American adults followed the 2016 presidential election in some medium or another last week, according to <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/04/the-2016-presidential-campaign-a-news-event-thats-hard-to-miss/">a report released today</a> by the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>Among survey respondents who said they had learned about the election, 24 percent said cable news was the most helpful way for them to follow the campaign. The next most helpful: social media and local TV, each at 14 percent. Only 3 percent of respondents said the print edition of a local newspaper was the most helpful way to follow the campaign, and just 2 percent said the same for national print papers.</p>
<p>Pew found significant generational differences in how Americans are learning about the election. Take cable TV: 43 percent of those 65 and older said it was their most helpful source of campaign news, compared to only 12 percent for 18- to 29-year-olds. That younger cohort was much more reliant on social media, with 35 percent of respondents saying that was the most helpful way to follow the campaign. That&#8217;s about double the next highest source for that age group, news apps or sites. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/PewElection2.jpg" alt="PewElection2" width="600" height="477" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>This is consistent with Pew&#8217;s previous research. Last year, it <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/06/pew-study-when-it-comes-to-political-news-facebook-has-become-local-tv-for-millennials/">released a study</a> showing Facebook had supplanted local TV as the primary political news source for millennials. According to that report, 61 percent of millennials said they got political news from Facebook compared to just 37 percent who said they learned about political news from local TV. That was the inverse of how baby boomers got their political news: 60 percent of Americans born between 1946 and 1964 said they got news from local TV and 39 percent said they found news on Facebook. </p>
<p>Party identification also leads to differences over the value of cable news: 34 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents, and 19 percent of Democrats called cable most helpful. Democrats were more likely to rely on local TV news than Republicans or independents.</p>
<p>Still, most U.S. adults get news about the presidential election from more than one source. The survey found that 45 percent of respondents learned about the election from more than five sources in a week. Only 9 percent used just one source. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/PewElection3.jpg" alt="PewElection3" width="300" height="468" class="nakedrightimage" />TV was the most popular way of learning about the election, with 78 percent saying they followed the election in either local TV news, cable TV news, the national nightly news, or late night comedy shows. That beat out digital at 65 percent of U.S. adults.</p>
<p>Print newspapers were the least popular popular way to follow the election, the report said, with only 36 percent of respondents saying they had gotten election news from one in the past week, though that doesn&#8217;t mean readers aren&#8217;t consuming newspaper election coverage online: </p>
<blockquote><p>The survey specifically asked about the print version of the paper and does not include the representation of newspapers in the digital space (48% of Americans got election news and information from news websites or apps in past week). This is an important distinction, as newspaper properties make up three of the top 10 digital news entities, according to comScore data compiled for our annual State of the News Media report. But it does speak to the precipitous decline of print as a mode of news — even as print-only consumers remain a key part of newspapers’ audiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>While 44 percent of American adults learned about the election on social media, the study found that among those that use social media, users are more likely to read about the election than share information about it. About half of users learned about the election from social media, but just 18 percent took the next step to share content about the election. Lower-income social media users were more likely to share election news on social media, the study found — &#8220;about 20% of social networking users with household incomes under $75,000, compared with 14% of those with incomes of $75,000 or more,&#8221; it said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you work with podcasts, how many times have you heard complaints about the difficulty of getting accurate data on audiences and their listening habits, and the lack of an industry standard? Probably too many times to count. Is a download a listen? Were listens on a web player figured into a podcast&#8217;s total audience? And so on. (Though podcast metrics are not, as <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/midroll-media-a-maker-and-monetizer-of-podcasts-bets-that-audio-can-be-good-enough-to-pay-for/">some have pointed out</a>, worse than, say, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/a16z/podcast-about-podcasts#t=21:10">broadcast radio measurements</a>.)</p>
<p>A group of public radio staffers from stations and networks across the U.S. have been working since spring of last year on comprehensive guidelines to help improve the accuracy and reliability of podcast audience measurement in the industry as a whole, and also help generate more consistent data for potential sponsors. The fruits of their discussions were published in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMORNRNyAR3L_03VYlvZK9dpKMk_d7pUxCnJfeKgVn0/edit">this document</a>, made available Tuesday. The recommendation, the report cautions, &#8220;are not intended to operate as a full technical standard per se, but rather overall principles and public radio’s technical guidelines for measuring podcast usage.&#8221; </p>
<p>The document first clearly defines the &#8220;slippery label&#8221; that is podcasting, distinguishing it as a subset of the broad category of on-demand audio: </p>
<blockquote><p>[Podcasts] consist of recurring shows or audio content collections. Measurement of downloads should include any form of on-demand, digital listening to that podcast, regardless of platform and inclusive of full episode downloads and downloads of segments of an episode. Often this is limited to audio files downloaded because they were enclosures in an RSS feed but may also include things like download links on a Web page or plays of an episode via a Web-based player.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also encourages organizations that rely on both internal and third-party metrics to choose as the &#8220;primary source&#8221; the metrics that &#8220;adhere closest to the guidelines outlined in this document,&#8221; noting that &#8220;the guidelines presented in this document have the greatest impact when adopted by the greatest number of organizations.&#8221; </p>
<p>The document also gets into the nitty gritty of measurement standards, such as how to best count unique downloads:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s difficult to count accurately the number of downloaders: no unique ID is transmitted when requesting a podcast file; multiple downloaders can use a single IP address (such as when they are on a shared private network); one downloader can have multiple IP addresses (such as when changing cellular towers).  Each downloader does transmit a user agent description which varies by software and sometimes by hardware used.  The combination of IP address and user agent provide something closer to a unique identifier for a device, which is itself an approximation of a unique identifier for a downloader. Where the user agent of the requesting client is available, this will be a count of the unique combinations of IP address and user agent for the period reported.  Otherwise, this will be a count of unique IP addresses for the period reported.</p></blockquote>
<p>NPR&#8217;s Boston-based Digital Services team is working now to incorporate these guidelines into the tracking mechanisms in its <a href="http://analytics.nprstations.org/?_ga=1.124667914.1806188866.1436305760">Station Analytics Service</a>, a digital metrics dashboard. Tweaks will be reflected next month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment.png" alt="Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment" width="611" height="482" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120843" srcset="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-100x79.png 100w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-160x126.png 160w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-260x205.png 260w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-360x284.png 360w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-480x379.png 480w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-600x473.png 600w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment-320x252.png 320w, http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Times-BlackHistoryMonth-comment.png 611w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" />In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/national/unpublished-black-history/school-integration-in-princeton-nj-1964-race-racism">this black and white photo</a> taken by a New York Times staff photographer, two unidentified second graders at Princeton’s Nassau Street Elementary School stand in front of a classroom blackboard. Some background text accompanies the image, pointing to a 1964 Times article about school integration and adding that the story &#8220;offered a caveat that still resonates, noting that in the search for a thriving and equal community, &#8216;good schooling is not enough.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Times readers wrote in to ask specifically about the second graders in the photo, so the Times updated the post with a comment form asking readers to share anything they might know about the girl and boy depicted.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/national/unpublished-black-history">Unpublished Black History</a>, a new Times project, is unearthing images from the paper&#8217;s vast photo archives that have never been published before (with the exception of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/national/unpublished-black-history/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-portrait-1963?module=ConversationPieces&#038;region=Body&#038;action=click&#038;pgtype=article">widely circulated headshot of Martin Luther King Jr.</a>) and contextualizing them, both in the grander scheme of history and in the historical coverage by the Times. Each day this month, in honor of Black History Month, the Times is running a photo or series of photos and telling their back stories. It&#8217;s sending occasional email updates about the photo project. It will continue these conversations in a broader newsletter, &#8220;Race/Related,&#8221; that will include elements of the current project along with other Times coverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t run photos back then the way we do today,&#8221; Times photo editor <a href="https://twitter.com/darcynyt">Darcy Eveleigh</a> said. Eveleigh is the curator and creator of <a href="http://livelymorgue.tumblr.com/about">The Lively Morgue</a>, a Times Tumblr that surfaces photos from the archives. &#8220;The Times had a small photo staff, and if these photographers were lucky, they might get one or two columns in the paper. The words ran long, and sometimes there wasn&#8217;t room to include them — it was a word paper back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few months ago, Times senior editor <a href="https://twitter.com/danacanedy">Dana Canedy</a> approached Eveleigh about leveraging the Times photo archives &#8212; <a href="http://livelymorgue.tumblr.com/about">roughly five to six million prints and contact sheets and 300,000 sacks of negatives, plus DVDs</a> &#8212; for Black History Month. Eveleigh began poring over the photos in search of a set of unpublished images to showcase, with the rule being that the images must have been taken by Times staff photographers (no wire photos allowed, for instance).</p>
<p>Her research turned up surprises: Eveleigh discovered, for instance, that the iconic <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/national/unpublished-black-history/dr-martin-luther-king-jr-portrait-1963">1963 Martin Luther King, Jr. portrait</a>, which ran the first day of the project but has been published countless times throughout Times history, was actually taken on set during a taping of a roundtable for NBC and was later cropped to look like a headshot, its context lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to pick a range of sports figures, civil rights figures, cultural events, dividing categories up in my brain the way the Times does, with a mix of light and serious moments,&#8221; Eveleigh said. &#8220;We can only show readers a very small portion of our collection of 10, 12 million images in 29 days.&#8221; </p>
<p>Times metro columnist <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelswarns">Rachel Swarns</a> and Times national desk deputy editor for digital <a href="https://twitter.com/damiencave">Damien Cave</a> joined the project, paring down the final collection and writing the text, with others helping figure out how to lay out the images digitally. </p>
<p>The project serves as a way for the Times to grapple with the past, present, and future of its race coverage, encouraging readers to share their own materials and memories and along the way shedding a little light on the journalistic process. (The reader responses on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are a mix: moving praise, but also some searing criticism of the Times&#8217;s record on coverage of issues of race and ethnicity.)</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s important is not only what you see but also what you don&#8217;t, and one of the things that was very striking as we were looking for images was just how many notable people we couldn&#8217;t find,&#8221; Swarns said (no staff photos of W.E.B. DuBois or Richard Wright, for instance). Some of that was due to limited staffing at the paper at the time and its emphasis on text, but &#8220;some of those holes were very likely because of the bias of some of our editors back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My thought as a digital deputy was to look for new ways to tell stories that is more Timesian, and this was a way to explore not just the stories we publish but also the process, and how things are published and when things aren&#8217;t, what gets left on the cutting room floor,&#8221; Cave said. &#8220;We also wanted to bring in the audience &#8212; do you know anything about this? Did you live through this? From the beginning, this was a community-driven project.&#8221;</p>
<p>A photo depicting Jackie Robinson in front of a lecture hall addressing a City College Sociology Society meeting, for instance, ran under the title &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/national/unpublished-black-history/jackie-robinson-lectures-city-college-baseball">A Jackie Robinson Mystery</a>.&#8221; &#8220;The New York Times didn’t publish an article about the ballplayer’s visit to City College that day,&#8221; the post reads. &#8220;So this morning we turned to you for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>As readers wrote in, sharing clippings from papers that had covered the talk, The Times updated the post to reflect the new information. A back-end system that collects reader comments tags these specific asks (e.g., What was going on in this Jackie Robinson photo? Do you know those second graders at the integrated Princeton school?) so editors can grab and share particular responses.</p>
A team of writers, editors, and developers worked together to figure out the right order and rhythm for a project that would work as a frequently updating daily, but will also be a self-contained archive online after this month. The project got an accompanying two-page spread in the print Times after it launched online, and select images and stories will also run in print throughout the month, as well as through the usual social channels. A few online readers have complained about running <a href="https://twitter.com/acwzywabit/status/694513159307157504">into the Times paywall</a> when trying to access Unpublished Black History; The Times is working to sort out that issue at the moment, Cave said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve gotten hundreds of people writing in on the form, and I don&#8217;t even know how many more through social media,&#8221; Swarns said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to put up things we get from readers. We&#8217;re interested in engaging our readers in a conversation about black history and about race more broadly, and we&#8217;re just getting started. These things have a way of taking you to unexpected places.&#8221; (&#8220;Thousands&#8221; are signed up to receive updates and the forthcoming newsletter, according to Cave.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that the voice of this project needed to be contemplative and self-examining rather than congratulatory,&#8221; Cave said. &#8220;We worked hard to make sure both the introduction and all the posts included a degree of transparency and openness and humility, and we&#8217;re hoping it can be a bit of a model for how we think about coverage of race moving forward.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div class="ednote"><p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note</strong>: Every news company, whether decades old or born digital, relies on the identification, recruitment, and cultivation of talent to succeed. And in a world where every journalist&#8217;s work is only a click away, it&#8217;s easier than ever for top people to be snapped up by a competitor.</p>
<p>Dartmouth business professor <a href="http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/sydney-finkelstein/">Sydney Finkelstein</a> studies leadership, and his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XIYGHYI/"><em>Superbosses: How Exceptional Leaders Master the Flow of Talent</em></a> looks at how a small number of business leaders, through their skill developing others, end up having an outsized impact on their fields. One of the &#8220;superbosses&#8221; he profiles is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roberts_(journalist)">Gene Roberts</a>, the legendary editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer (and a Nieman Fellow, Class of 1962). Here, Finkelstein outlines how Roberts attracted the talent needed to turn a disreputable newspaper into one of America&#8217;s best.</p></div></p>
<p><em>&#8220;If you were a reporter and you didn&#8217;t love working for Gene Roberts, there was something wrong with you.&#8221; —Don Barlett</em></p>
<p><div class="storybreak-simple"><span></span></div></p>
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Roberts_(journalist)">Gene Roberts</a> joined <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, the paper didn&#8217;t have a whole lot going for it. In fact, according to <a href="http://www.barlettandsteele.com/about.php">Don Barlett</a>, Knight Newspapers (a predecessor of Knight Ridder) had in 1970 bought an operation that was &#8220;totally corrupt, top to bottom.&#8221; Former owner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Annenberg">Walter Annenberg</a> had an unusual way of doing business: He didn&#8217;t allow certain local figures to appear in the paper at all. The list of enemies included the president of the University of Pennsylvania. Every photo in which certain local leaders appeared had to be cropped to eliminate Annenberg&#8217;s offenders. The paper&#8217;s chief investigative reporter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Karafin">Harry Karafin</a>, was <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/the-reporter/?all=1">unmasked by Philadelphia magazine</a> as blackmailing subjects of his reporting. He was <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rt8jAAAAIBAJ&#038;sjid=EygEAAAAIBAJ&#038;pg=7378,1437390&#038;dq=harry+karafin&#038;hl=en">convicted of extortion</a> and sent to prison. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/superbosses.jpg" alt="superbosses" width="250" height="auto" class="nakedrightimage" />When Knight supplanted the Annenberg ownership, editor <a href="http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&#038;d=DS19691231.2.45">John McMullan</a> came on board to clean house. He fired a bunch of staffers, and relocated others to various desk jobs. The staff wasn&#8217;t thrilled. Time magazine referred to McMullan&#8217;s tenure as &#8220;a reign of terror&#8221; that resulted in &#8220;staff resentment.&#8221; Throughout these two eras, the Inquirer was clearly the number two paper behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Bulletin">Philadelphia Bulletin</a> — meaning it had less staff, less budget and less clout. Most significantly, the paper wasn&#8217;t making any money.</p>
<p>Roberts had chosen to leave the best paper in the country, The New York Times, where he&#8217;d been regularly promoted and was well-liked by his colleagues, to run a disreputable paper whose staff was more or less in crisis. &#8220;I thought he was nuts,&#8221; commented <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/us/james-m-naughton-reporter-and-editor-dies-at-73.html?_r=0">Jim Naughton</a>, who in 1977 would join the staff himself. The reason behind Roberts&#8217; decision was simple: Roberts was more interested in fixing something that was broken (like the Inquirer) than maintaining something that was already doing well (like The New York Times). He wanted to make a paper truly his own — and make it one of the top papers in the country.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carroll_(journalist)">John Carroll</a>, one of Roberts&#8217; most illustrious protégés, there was something exciting about Roberts taking over at the Inquirer. He remembered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The people at The New York Times told me [Roberts] was the best editor there, and here he was coming to this newspaper that was a terrible newspaper, and he was going to build it from the ground up. I figured what better chance would there be to [learn about the business] than to do it for this guy who has such a good reputation and [to] come in on the ground floor of a rebuilding job.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the turnaround of the Inquirer had many central planks in it, none was more important than talent.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Talent finder</h3>
<p>Roberts preferred not to fire any of the staffers hired under Annenberg, opting instead to &#8220;swing them lefthanded if they can&#8217;t bat righthanded.&#8221; Carroll elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>He had a keen eye for matching a particular person with a particular task. He would take somebody from one department of the paper and move them to something utterly different, something that would have never occurred to me. And very often if would be a brilliant stroke that would make that person&#8217;s career much better and make the paper much better.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Inquirer building was full of long hallways with little offices shooting off in different directions. Roberts would stand at the hallway, sighing to himself as he considered how to shift staff around. &#8220;You can&#8217;t emphasize too much,&#8221; Barlett said to me, &#8220;[Roberts&#8217;] ability to see talent where other employers couldn&#8217;t see it.&#8221; One of the people Roberts revitalized was <a href="http://articles.philly.com/1999-08-30/news/25482658_1_inquirer-eugene-l-roberts-robert-j-rosenthal">Edgar &#8220;Ted&#8221; Williams</a>, a talented writer McMullan had assigned to a desk job processing the comic strips. Roberts directed him to a job writing features, and Williams became one of the premier feature writers on the staff.</p>
<p>Roberts also set about hiring leaders of his own. &#8220;Virtually every hire,&#8221; Roberts would say years later, &#8220;should be part of a long-range master plan of journalistic excellence.&#8221; One of his first hires at the paper was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Lovelady">Steve Lovelady</a>, who was editing stories heading for the front page of The Wall Street Journal before Roberts wooed him away. Gene Foreman recalled what Lovelady told him about how he was hired:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Roberts] called Lovelady over at the Journal and said, &#8220;Steve, I&#8217;m going to Philadelphia,&#8221; and Steve said, &#8220;Yeah, I read that in the paper today.&#8221; Then he [Roberts] said, &#8220;Want to come along?&#8221; Lovelady said, &#8220;Are you crazy? The paper is failing down there in Philadelphia. The Wall Street Journal is The Wall Street Journal. I&#8217;ve got a good job here.&#8221; Gene said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true, but you need to talk to me about this.&#8221; So he talked to him, and pretty soon Lovelady was one of his first hires at the Inquirer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Foreman himself — who became Roberts&#8217; number two at the paper and experienced the sight of Phillies shortstop <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bowala01.shtml">Larry Bowa</a> jumping out of his birthday cake in the newsroom — had never planned to move to Philadelphia. &#8220;I had spent my early thirties looking for my &#8216;destination paper&#8217; — the paper where I&#8217;d really spend my career,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I found that paper at Newsday.&#8221; Newsday is the dominant daily on Long Island. Foreman had arrived there in the fall of 1971, basically doing the job of assistant managing editor by a different title (executive news editor). </p>
<p>When he was told by a mutual friend that Roberts wanted to talk to him about a job, Foreman planned to decline. But out of respect for Roberts and his friend, he drove to Philadelphia to meet Roberts for lunch. Roberts was an hour late, and he didn&#8217;t make any reference to his tardiness when he finally arrived. They ate and talked in generalities, and as they rode a cab to the Inquirer building, Roberts asked Foreman to dinner (never mind that they&#8217;d just eaten). When Roberts got out of the cab, he handed the driver $20, telling him to just drive his friend around the city. That night, after a long dinner conversation, Foreman was still mystified about what Roberts had in mind. Finally he asked, &#8220;What kind of job are we talking about?&#8221; Roberts replied, &#8220;I was kind of thinking managing editor.&#8221; &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; Foreman said, shocked because he had assumed Roberts would offer a job on the same level he occupied in Newsday editor hierarchy. It&#8217;s significant to note that Roberts made his choice the first day he met Foreman in person — it was a gut-instinct decision that paid off for both editors. A few weeks later, Foreman started work at the Inquirer, where he would manage newsroom operations for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>When asked how he managed to entice talented people with jobs at better papers to move to a new city and work for a struggling paper, Roberts paused. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t attract them with money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Instead we offered them a vision that we could be a really excellent newspaper and a congenial workplace.&#8221; This plan, simple as it may seem, worked.</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Talent magnet</h3>
<p>Roberts&#8217; uncanny ability to, as Don Barlett put it, &#8220;seize on talent anywhere in the country&#8221; as well revitalize the existing staff enabled him to breathe life into the failing paper. As the quality of the paper increased, the Inquirer became inundated with applications. &#8220;Instead of having to woo people, they started wooing us,&#8221; Roberts remembered. &#8220;Ultimately we had a lot of people to look at and pick the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Occasionally Roberts would happen upon someone whom he liked, but he didn&#8217;t have a job for at the moment. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try Greensboro, son?&#8221; Roberts would advise the applicant. He had arrangements with southern papers to serve as training camps of sorts for people he wanted to hire later. When the time was right, he brought them to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Occasionally, though, the Inquirer would still go talent-hunting, and Roberts put Jim Naughton in charge of finding fresh voices. Naughton&#8217;s style for wooing candidates may have indicated how far the paper had come since Roberts began as editor. At one point, Naughton bought a baby blue Mustang as a recruiting tool. He was pursuing an opinion columnist from the south and knew, having read her columns for weeks, that it was her dream car. Roberts thought Naughton was nuts, but agreed to reimburse him the $1,200 for the car if the columnist came on board. Naughton drove the Mustang down to columnist&#8217;s hometown in Mississippi and left it with a note that read, &#8220;Bring this back to Philadelphia if you want to take the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The columnist declined. She couldn&#8217;t imagine leaving the south. Years later, after she&#8217;d established herself as a staffer at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she sent Naughton a check for the $1,200.</p>
<p>It is significant to note how aggressive and creative the recruiting techniques became over the time Roberts was on board. And often the techniques worked. The Inquirer successfully scooped talent from The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, and other leading papers — people who were attracted by the creative atmosphere in Philadelphia. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanews-steve-lopez-20130507-staff.html">Steve Lopez</a>, now one of the lead columnists at the LA Times and author of the book <em>The Soloist</em> (later a 2009 hit movie starring Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey, Jr.), sent dozens of business cards to Naughton in an effort to get his attention. Lopez handwrote his home number on the card. A lot of talented people wanted to work with Gene Roberts. And, if numbers are any indicator, Roberts hated to turn them down.</p>
<p>When Roberts came on board, Foreman estimates that there were 250 employees. By the mid-1980s, the size of the staff had doubled. &#8220;As we went into the black, the parent corporation was willing to give a little more money,&#8221; Roberts said. The paper had their own foreign correspondents, and journalists were able to work in teams to cover big stories. Some stories had over a hundred people working on them. &#8220;It was an unbelievable playpen for a lot of great writers,&#8221; remembered <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthowe">Art Howe</a>, a Pulitzer Prize winner under Roberts who went on to found a number of Pennsylvania weekly papers. These writers wanted to be at the Inquirer not only to do great journalism and work with &#8220;the Frog,&#8221; as Roberts was nicknamed, but also to have a terrific time.</p>
<p>Roberts would reflect later: &#8220;Many of America&#8217;s finest journalists were beating a path to the Inquirer. Let me assure you, it wasn&#8217;t the money that was attracting them. It was the chance to practice great journalism and have fun while doing it.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Epilogue</h3>
<p>Roberts left The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1990. Knight Ridder was squeezing the newspaper&#8217;s budget, and it was evident that cuts would continue. In this environment, Roberts faced the prospect of presiding over a systemic diminishing of the newspaper he had built.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 years later, his staff would gather again to celebrate the good times and groan over the changes in the journalism industry. Organized by one of Roberts&#8217; former reporters, <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2008-10-26/news/25263615_1_top-journalist-eugene-l-roberts-william-k-marimow">Carol Horner</a>, the reunion was promoted with posters depicting a frog leaning against the Inquirer building. &#8220;The frog leapt here,&#8221; read the caption, underscoring Roberts&#8217; centrality to the event. Over 300 people came. <a href="http://www.rtoinsider.com/about-our-editor-and-publisher/">Rich Heidorn</a>, a former reporter, described the event:</p>
<blockquote><p>The talent in the picnic pavilion where we gathered was jaw-dropping: At least 16 Pulitzer winners attended, along with alums who have gone on to author best-selling or award-winning books, including Buzz Bissinger (<em>Friday Night Lights</em>); Sharon Wohlmuth (<em>Sisters</em>, <em>Mothers and Daughters</em>, and <em>Best Friends</em>); Mark Bowden (<em>Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War</em>); Tim Weiner (winner of the National Book Award for <em>Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA</em>), and Hank Klibanoff (who, with Roberts, authored <em>The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle and the Awakening of a Nation</em>, winner of the 2007 Pulitzer for history).</p></blockquote>
<p>Steve Seplow, former metro editor, basked in the nostalgic vibe of the reunion as he commented on the Roberts era: &#8220;I think for at least 10 to 12 of those years we were putting out the most interesting paper in America. [It] may not have been the most complete — but it was the most interesting, the most imaginative, and did some of the greatest journalism. And it&#8217;s amazing how much warmth is still here, how much commitment there was to doing it. And you can feel it here.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I waited for the results of the Iowa caucuses to come in last night, I found myself constantly pulling down pages on my phone to refresh them. Heaven forbid that I wait a few minutes to see whether Trump had ticked ahead of Cruz.</p>
<p>Then I saw this tweet:</p>

<p><a href="http://apps.bostonglobe.com/election-results/2016/">The tool</a>, available on desktop and mobile, offered just what I needed to stare at mindlessly. It was fast and clean, no manual refresh was required, and I wasn&#8217;t the only one who liked it.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The project, which pulled in AP data, was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelWorkman">Michael Workman</a>, the Globe&#8217;s digital design director, with a team including software engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnjflaherty">John Flaherty</a>, newsroom developer <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielflorit">Gabriel Florit</a>, and designer <a href="https://twitter.com/elainanatario">Elaina Natario</a>. &#8220;We had a lot of people who enjoyed staring at it,&#8221; Workman told me. The app built on <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/election-results/2014-11-04/race/MA/Governor/">a similar project</a> that the Globe did in 2014 for the gubernatorial election, but &#8220;we pretty much changed everything from top to bottom,&#8221; Workman said. &#8220;One of the things we were able to do was get the reload time down to 15 seconds, from 60 in 2014. That definitely added to the engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/election-results/2016/caucuses/republican/iowa/">Republican</a> and <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/election-results/2016/caucuses/democratic/iowa/">Democratic</a> results pages were the two most viewed pages of the day on BostonGlobe.com.</p>
<p>The Globe&#8217;s social media team then used screenshots from the app to promote it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Democratic <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IowaCaucus?src=hash">#IowaCaucus</a> at 99.41% precincts reporting.

<p>&mdash; The Boston Globe (@BostonGlobe) <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/694412271259389952">February 2, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The Globe&#8217;s tweets linking to the app pulled in about 10 times the traffic that the Globe normally gets to article pages via Twitter. &#8220;It proved out that the direction we&#8217;re heading is probably the right one,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/mkarolian">Matt Karolian</a>, the Globe&#8217;s social media director, said. &#8220;Given the success we&#8217;ve seen on Twitter, we&#8217;ll do some additional promotion on Facebook&#8221; ahead of the New Hampshire primaries on February 9.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re scaling this up to the remaining primaries and then, obviously, the general election,&#8221; Workman said. &#8220;We&#8217;re making sure that we have a good, robust framework that will support us all the way through November.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology site <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/">The Information</a> is inviting some of its subscribers to join it on a trip to China next month.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a junket. Attendees are responsible for paying for their own travel, lodging, and other costs. (One assumes subscribers to The Information can handle the tab.) What&#8217;s in it for them: &#8220;several events with well-known entrepreneurs, executives, and investors from China&#8217;s largest and most promising technology companies like Xiaomi, Tencent as well as a host of startups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working hard to put you in the same room with the people only the most well-known execs typically meet,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicalessin">Jessica Lessin</a>, founder and CEO of The Information, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/come-with-the-information-to-china">explained in a post</a>. (Almost all content on the site is behind a paywall, but this post isn&#8217;t.)</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know, we’re very excited about China at The Information. And so, we’re thrilled to invite a small number of our subscribers to join me for a special opportunity for exclusive, on-the-ground access to technology leaders in Beijing the week of March 14, 2016.</p>
<p>We’re looking for a small number of U.S. entrepreneurs, executives and investors to join us to share their experiences on the ground in Silicon Valley or wherever their home base is&#8230;As you know, one of the most important things about business travel is meeting the right people&#8230;Space is limited to keep the events intimate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lessin wouldn&#8217;t comment beyond saying that the company is &#8220;heads down&#8221; preparing for the trip.</p>
<p>The idea of the China trip makes sense for a site that is all about premium access. The Information only publishes two stories most days, &#8220;<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/about">deeply-reported articles about the technology industry that you won&#8217;t find elsewhere</a>.&#8221; For this, readers pay $399 a year or $39 a month (the China trip is only open to annual subscribers). Members also get access to a private Slack channel, commenting privileges, and special events like a <a href="http://events.theinformation.com/">subscriber summit</a>.</p>
<p>Lessin, a former technology reporter for The Wall Street Journal, launched the site in 2013; it now has thousands of subscribers (&#8220;multiples&#8221; higher than 2,000, Lessin <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-the-information-makes-with-its-subscription-business-model-2016-1">told Business Insider recently</a>).</p>
<p>The site&#8217;s business model &#8220;totally scales — and it gives us control over how it scales,&#8221; Lessin <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/informations-jessica-lessin-business-model-news-broken/">told Digiday in January</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts. This is Issue Fifty-Eight, published February 2, 2016.</p>
<p>First day of fun-employment! Self-employment, I mean. Gotta find a way to make money.</p>
<p><strong>FiveThirtyEight enters the elections podcast race.</strong> Let&#8217;s start with an item thematically related to what went down in Iowa last night.</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight, the data journalism site led by stats dude Nate Silver, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-fivethirtyeights-new-elections-podcast/">officially launched its Elections podcast last Monday</a>. And let me be the first to say: Finally! Predictive modeling for presidential elections is basically the only reason I keep FiveThirtyEight in my bookmarks, though I must say their culture stuff gets a click or two out of me. Anyway, this launch expands the site&#8217;s podcast offering to a healthy number of three, with the elections pods joining a sports punditry show called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hot-takedown/id976726020?mt=2">Hot Takedown</a> and a more general show about data and society called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/whats-the-point/id1011406983?mt=2">What&#8217;s The Point</a>. Its launch comes after four weeks of piloting through the What&#8217;s The Point feed, where test episodes were delivered to listeners in the form of bonus content. Which is certainly an interesting method of both workshopping a show and cultivating interest in an existing user base.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the most interesting thing about FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s Elections podcast: It&#8217;s made up of different kinds of shows. The podcast&#8217;s anchor will be a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slates-political-gabfest/id158004641?mt=2">Slate Political Gabfest</a>-style panel show that will be released on Mondays, with additional episodes — which may or may not adopt the panel discussion format — dropping on other days depending on the news cycle and depending on whether the podcast team has something else they want to cover. Some of these non-Monday episodes could be a documentary; some could feature interviews.</p>
<p>This diversification of content was top of mind for <a href="https://twitter.com/jodyavirgan?lang=en">Jody Avirgan</a>, the former WNYC producer that the site tapped last year to head up its podcast operations. (Avirgan is also the host of What&#8217;s The Point.) &#8220;From the beginning, I wanted our election audio coverage to be a bunch of different things. I wanted it to be a home for reported stories, documentaries, etc.,&#8221; he told me over the phone. &#8220;I think a lot of people are hung up on the idea of &#8216;a show,&#8217; and that you would have to do the same thing week after week after week just because you have &#8216;a show.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In this view, the podcast feed is structurally utilized in a manner reminiscent to linear TV news or radio broadcast channels, but without the need to plug gaps with filler content or reruns. For Avirgan, it&#8217;s a mark of confidence in the pull of the larger media operation, and not a specific show. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just have a home for the audio content we make, and people will follow us to wherever we create,&#8221; Avirgan continued. &#8220;I think Grantland has been a good model all along — the way they created one feed, and put all their shows all in one feed. People who like Grantland really like Grantland, and they don&#8217;t care where they get it. They just want to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight is not the first to play around with release conventions through a podcast feed. NPR&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pop-culture-happy-hour/id278974813?mt=2">Pop Culture Happy Hour</a>, for example, is particularly good with experimentation, consistently using its feed to drop alternate programming like its sporadically-released sports show (<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2015/07/14/418642986/pop-culture-happy-hour-on-sports-introducing-the-giant-foam-finger">The Giant Foam Finger!!</a>) as well as special interviews (<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2015/11/02/453152339/writing-career-of-evil-gave-robert-galbraith-aka-j-k-rowling-nightmares">J.K. Rowling!!</a>). Another interesting practitioner is the Bill Simmons Podcast Network&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/channel-33/id1058911614?mt=2">Channel 33</a>&#8221; feed, which essentially serves as an omnibus home for Simmons&#8217; frequent collaborators and former Grantland soldiers to play around with their own shows (The Watch and Sources Say are <em>fabulous</em>, by the way). But I&#8217;m a little surprised more podcast creators don&#8217;t experiment more with the RSS feed. We&#8217;ve seen some interesting, playful uses over among fiction podcasts; for example, the recent fictional podcast hit Limetown occasionally dropped mini-sode checkins to conjure the illusion of &#8220;real-time&#8221; programming. Maybe I&#8217;m just talking out of an armchair, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like it would take too much of an effort for an actual campaign trail reporter to experiment by using a feed to sporadically drop 5 minute verbal sketches of scene and space. (See: Audio Twitter.)</p>
<p>Anyway, back to talking about the actual podcast: the Elections podcast&#8217;s launch comes up against what appears to be an increasingly crowded field. <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/hot-pod-charting-the-outflow-of-public-radio-talent-to-the-new-for-profit-podcast-industry/">As I&#8217;ve noted recently</a>, it seems like there&#8217;s been another election-related pod being launched every other day, with new offerings being rolled by both podcast stalwarts and newcomers (sample list: NPR&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/npr-politics-podcast/id1057255460?mt=2">Politics Podcast</a>, The Washington Post&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/presidential/id1072170823?mt=2">Presidential</a>, Politico&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/off-message/id987591126?mt=2">Off Message</a>, The Huffington Post&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/candidate-confessional-defeated/id1073764351?mt=2">Candidate Confessional</a>, Futuro Media Group&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/@julito77/what-happens-when-four-journalists-get-together-to-talk-about-the-gopdebate-d94348972ae9#.4fwc4en9r">In the Thick</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pollsters/id980260566?mt=2">The Pollsters</a>, and many others.) I asked Avirgan what he thought about this flood of audio election programming. His response was a dry one: &#8220;There&#8217;s this perfect storm of people who think that podcasting is an easy money thing, and there&#8217;s big news cycle event coming, and so they just put the two things together,&#8221; Avirgan said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure if this was Brazil and the World Cup was coming up, you&#8217;d see a lot of World Cup podcasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>But will the abundance of these podcasts prove a hurdle for FiveThirtyEight, whose mass-market raison d&#8217;être, for all intents and purposes, is elections-focused data journalism? Avirgan doesn&#8217;t think so, citing operational nimbleness, close fidelity to its audience, and a keen awareness of the space as differentiating factors. &#8220;There&#8217;s a reason our show is on Monday versus other days,&#8221; Avirgan notes. &#8220;We&#8217;re separated [from other podcasts] on the calendar&#8230;We&#8217;re not going to pull off what the [Slate Political] Gabfest does. We have our own people. We&#8217;re going to do what we&#8217;re good at.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Podcasts, but for podcasts.</strong> Or broadcasts, but for podcasts. Or broadcasts, but for podcasts that are also later distributed as podcasts. </p>
<p>A common refrain among those who are involved in or follow podcasts is that discovery is broken, and its broken-ness is one of the many primary structural impediments that prevents podcasts from growing, maturing, and becoming mainstream, which is arguably what everybody wants. So far, all we really have is iTunes, and even that audience development pipeline is being further corroded by the recent podcast rush that has undoubtedly led to increased competition for real estate on iTunes. It is perhaps inevitable, then, that this unfortunate state of affairs would lead to a situation where we see a bunch of launches involving podcasts dedicated to the curation of high-quality podcasts for the pleasure of mass earballs.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, we saw the birth of Gimlet&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sampler/id1068516341?mt=2">Sampler</a> and Washington public radio station WAMU&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-big-listen/id1079968336?mt=2">The Big Listen</a>, two shows from different sides of the public/private podcasting divide. They join the Canadian Broadcasting Company&#8217;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/podcast-playlist-from-cbc/id1064472703?mt=2">Podcast Playlist</a>, which was the first high-profile attempt to execute on this particular idea. (Disclaimer: I&#8217;ve been a guest on the podcast before.) Playlist was first launched in the summer of 2015 with WNYC&#8217;s Sean Rameswaram (who is actually Canadian, by the way) performing sole host and curation duties. Its current iteration features in-house hosts Lindsay Michael and Matt Galloway, presumably because Rameswaram had to go back to his home station to develop whatever secret project he is no doubt developing at this very second.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a second to think about the bigger idea at play here. These shows ostensibly exist to perform a specific structural function for their respective audiences, which is to provide guidance through the hyper-abundant, anarchic, and desperately overwhelming offerings of the wider podcast ecosystem whose low barriers to entry and democratic promise, while much lauded, are ultimately counterintuitive to actual consumption.</p>
<p>In my mind, the emergence of these podcasts about podcasts could well be thought of as an echo to what happened with the rise of aggregation among the blogosphere back in the mid-2000s. Wiser folks than I have <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/podcasting-in-2015-feels-a-lot-like-blogging-circa-2004-exciting-evolving-and-trouble-for-incumbents/">already written about the structural and developmental similarities between blogs and podcasting</a>, but I&#8217;d like to go further here and draw a straight line between these podcasts about podcasts and blog aggregators. The latter plays the very same role as the former: to streamline the reader&#8217;s experience of the rest of the Internet&#8217;s &#8220;Wild West&#8221; within the same medium. And though the value-add for the aggregated is the potential of a clickthrough, a retention, and a conversion, there&#8217;s an opportunity for the aggregator to leverage any attention gained for its curatorial prowess to further establish power and authority in the space.</p>
<p>But before any of these podcasts about podcasts can become authorities, they must first figure out how to differentiate themselves from each other. The three shows actually do a pretty good job of being compositionally different from one another — Playlist opts to play a bunch of segments straight with bits of set-up here and there, Sampler is much swifter with its clips, and The Big Listen, at least with the one episode that&#8217;s out so far, seems to really favor interviews with creators — but all three shows <em>sound</em> strikingly similar. This might be a function, perhaps, of CBC&#8217;s and WAMU&#8217;s public radio stature, and of Gimlet&#8217;s overall public radio roots, even though Sampler host Brittany Luse herself is not of the public radio world. (Luce comes to Gimlet from the very good <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/for-colored-nerds/id957205646?mt=2">For Colored Nerds</a> podcast, which sounds nothing like her work on Sampler — which may itself be an expression of the issue at hand.) And all three shows also seem to use the same type of narrative tools (creator interviews, play and response, etc.) within the episode-level to perform the same duties and that, in turn, leads to a relative homogeneity in sound.</p>
<p>Which raises the question: What tools do these podcasts have to differentiate themselves? Seems obvious to say, but aside from basic standards of audio quality (and sometimes, not even that), the differentiation ultimately comes down to a mix between the strength of the curator&#8217;s personality — podcasts and radio shows are principally personality-driven, after all — and, well, the curator&#8217;s taste, which itself is a function of her or his personality. Which is all to say this: These podcasts should really lean harder into the specificities of its hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Will big money squeeze out independent podcasting?</strong> Here&#8217;s a quote that&#8217;s pertinent to the independent podcasters out in the audience:</p>
<blockquote><p>I worry about big money pouring into podcasting. Not so much for ourselves — I think we&#8217;ve carved out our little space and we&#8217;ll be okay. But I worry about people being able to do what we did. &#8220;I have a weird idea and I have a $60 USB microphone, and I&#8217;m going to just make this thing and maybe someone will listen to it.&#8221; I think that is what appealed to me about podcasting from the very start, and I really, really hope that all the money pouring into podcasting won&#8217;t bury tiny, weird independent podcasts like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>That nugget comes from <a href="http://www.welcometonightvale.com/">Welcome to Night Vale&#8217;s</a> Joseph Fink, who was being interviewed along with cocreator Jeffrey Cranor, on-stage in D.C. last November. The interview recording was published last week as part of the Pop Culture Happy Hour (that&#8217;s two mentions in one newsletter, oy!) <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2016/01/29/464694237/pop-culture-happy-hour-in-conversation-with-fred-armisen-and-welcome-to-night-va">Blizzard Special</a>, and you should definitely check out the whole conversation.</p>
<p>For context, Fink was expressing concern of how money flowing into the podcasting space may well suppress opportunities for the new, the small, the different, and the weird. First acknowledging that the podcasting space is generally a lot more exciting now than it was five years ago, Fink then highlighted the entry of bigger players with bigger wallets into the podcasting space, like Bill Simmons setting up his own podcast network, GE funding a big weird fiction project in <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/how-did-the-ge-branded-podcast-the-message-hit-no-1-on-itunes-in-part-by-sounding-nothing-like-an-ad/">The Message</a>, and WNYC <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/hot-pod-wnyc-is-ready-to-make-a-15-million-move-into-podcasts/">rolling $15 million</a> into a podcast studio.</p>
<p>Again, I highly recommend you <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2016/01/29/464694237/pop-culture-happy-hour-in-conversation-with-fred-armisen-and-welcome-to-night-va">check out the whole interview</a> — which touches upon Night Vale&#8217;s business model, the team&#8217;s favorite podcasts, and more — but for reference, this segment begins at the 31:56 mark.</p>
<p><strong>NPR signs with Triton Digital&#8217;s Tap Podcast platform For advertising.</strong> More CMS news!</p>
<p>NPR, everybody&#8217;s favorite public radio mothership, announced yesterday that it has signed a deal with Triton Digital&#8217;s audio advertising platform for podcast monetization and distribution purposes, <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/267940/npr-selects-triton-digitals-tap-podcast-tool-to-h.html">according to MediaPost</a>. That&#8217;s a big get for Triton, who initially announced the launch of platform early last month, so you could probably imagine that this deal has been on the stove for a while.</p>
<p>Okay, real talk for a sec: The past few weeks have seen an uptick of podcast-CMS-related developments from several key players — Acast, Panoply (my former day job employer), Art19, now Triton Digital — many of which are relatively new. What we&#8217;re seeing now is some sort of land grab, with each of these players hitting the market in a rush to sign as many podcasts that are still being hosted on LibSyn or SoundCloud — which those podcasts probably chose because, well, those two were probably perceived to be the only options. (And SoundCloud is basically free, so that&#8217;s a big plus for them.) At some point, I&#8217;ll make a living comparative spreadsheet of who powers who, because most (though not all) of that information is made publicly available by these companies and because that&#8217;ll probably make a useful consumer guide for somebody.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re one of these podcasts that&#8217;s still figuring out your CMS situation, I gotta say: it&#8217;s a great and speculative time! Remember to ask questions, shop around, and consult your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Nerdist Sports.</strong> Jonah Keri, the former ESPN/Grantland sports writer and podcaster, has found a new home for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-jonah-keri-podcast/id1079236780?mt=2">his podcast</a> in Chris Hardwick&#8217;s Nerdist Industries, which also happens to be the home of some really amazing podcasts like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/james-bonding/id695880236?mt=2">James Bonding</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/thrilling-adventure-hour/id408691897?mt=2">The Thrilling Adventure Hour</a>. It might not sound like the most obvious of hits, but that&#8217;s because Keri&#8217;s podcast will serve the flagship show of what will eventually become the network&#8217;s new sports vertical — a subject matter that the network has previously never ventured into. According to Keri&#8217;s preamble on <a href="http://nerdist.com/the-jonah-keri-podcast-1-chris-hardwick/">the first episode of the relaunched show</a> (which features an interview with the notoriously giggly Hardwick himself), he&#8217;s going to be fairly involved with whatever comes out of this new vertical — <a href="https://twitter.com/jonahkeri/status/691985052201324544">on Twitter</a>, he described his plans as &#8220;copious&#8221; — even though he&#8217;s unsure of the exact details at this point in time. </p>
<p>In related news, <a href="http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/nerdist-podcast-network-expands-1201691110/">Variety reports</a> that Nerdist Industries is greatly expanding its network, and now boasts a total of nearly 50 podcasts. And that&#8217;s not even taking its video offerings into consideration. Yikes!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We end every year here at Nieman Lab with our <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/collection/predictions-2016/">annual predictions package</a>, and one of the main themes that emerged out of the more than 100 contributions we received looking forward to 2016 was that product management would prove to become even more important this year. </p>
<p>Product managers &#8220;will be the interdisciplinary heart of media organizations where editorial and business come together to create better products, drawing a page from Silicon Valley’s playbook,&#8221; Storify cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/burtherman">Burt Herman</a> <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/begun-the-platform-war-has/">wrote</a>. Texas State University professor <a href="https://twitter.com/CindyRoyal">Cindy Royal</a> <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/product-management-is-the-new-journalism/">predicted</a> that in 2016, &#8220;media organizations and journalism schools will begin to comprehend and define product management and embrace it as a relevant and critical career path.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Press Institute also agrees that product management is important, and today it&#8217;s out today with a <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/product-management-best-practices/">white paper</a> that attempts to answer that question by outlining a number of tips and best practices. API convened a group of 45 product managers and executives from a number of outlets — both local and national, and digital-native and legacy — to discuss their product strategies. </p>
<p>The five-chapter report, written by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffsonderman">Jeff Sonderman</a>, is certainly worth reading in full, but here are some of the main points:</p>
<h3 class="subhead">Collaboration is critical</h3>
<p>Product people need to work effectively across departments in any news organization. That means that staffers working on a particular project must focus on their work and not get involved in internal politics or turf battles. “You want everybody to be fiercely loyal to the team and to the [user’s] problem that you’re trying to solve,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BenFrench">Ben French</a>, vice president of product at The New York Times said in the paper. “That loyalty is often in great contradiction to loyalty to their department.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also key for staffers involved in product to be in regular contact with those in the newsroom: &#8220;This creates familiarity, trust and understanding — the basis for collaborating and succeeding on big projects down the road.&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksmielczarek">Aleksander Mielczarek</a>, a senior product manager at Time Inc., explained how Time&#8217;s move into a new building was making this easier: </p>
<blockquote><p>I’m in the Time &#038; Life building, we are literally maybe 30 floors, and I think every group I work with is on a different floor, and you have to take different elevator banks — it takes 10 minutes to get from place to place. We’re actually moving to the Freedom Tower site, and we (print, digital, product, business development, etc.) are all on the same floor. Big, open-concept. I cannot tell you the excitement both teams have around that.</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="subhead">Leaders need to set priorities  — and make sure they&#8217;re executed</h3>
<p>Top leaders need to articulate their goals and then empower their team to go out and achieve them the report said, &#8220;Clear decisions and edicts from the top manager can empower the process to really begin — removing debate and resistance about <em>whether</em> we should even do this or not. Make it a question of <em>how</em> to proceed and how to reach the goal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-anderson-203a711">Jeff Anderson</a>, digital media director at The Virginian-Pilot&#8217;s parent company, explained how the paper&#8217;s publisher put made the user&#8217;s need a priority by mandating that the Pilot build a responsive website despite some objections: </p>
<blockquote><p>[The publisher said] we have to move to a responsive design, over some objection from advertising who said you’re going to crater our revenue by switching a desktop page with five ads to a mobile one with one ad, and we’re not going to make our goals with that,” Anderson said. “The publisher said, ‘I don’t care, we have to meet our audience demands. This is a long-term play’&#8230;[Without that], we would have been on a back-and-forth debate for months over what to do, whether to do it.</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="subhead">What to look for when you&#8217;re hiring a product manager</h3>
<p>You need someone who thinks of news as a product: </p>
<blockquote><p>Most people at legacy media organizations tended to think of “news” as just the articles or video packages they produce day-to-day. Product managers have to think about the whole experience of the user — what they should get from that news and how they want to consume it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone who takes on a product role also needs to be an advocate for the user, someone who values readers as an important part of the news ecosystem. The ideal product person is also someone who is able to develop relationships throughout an organization and can also deal with managing conflicts. </p>
<p>And to ensure diversity, the report says managers should look for someone who is a &#8220;culture add,&#8221; not necessarily a &#8220;culture fit.&#8221; </p>
<blockquote><p>One culprit is that managers enter the recruiting process looking for “culture fit” — someone who will think like and act like the rest of the team. This naturally leads to hiring people who tend to also look like and come from the same socioeconomic backgrounds as your existing team. Instead, look for “culture add” in your candidates — the traits, experiences and skills that are exciting because they’re not present in your current team.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most Thursday mornings start the same way for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobson-seth-72892597">Seth Jacobson</a>, the editor in charge of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-times-of-london-weekly/id1066321014?mt=8">The Times of London Weekly</a>, a new app aimed at readers outside the U.K. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/TimesofLondon_notification.jpeg" alt="TimesofLondon_notification" width="300" height="122" class="nakedrightimage"/>The app is released each Thursday, so that morning Jacobson begins reading through everything that&#8217;s published in that day&#8217;s paper and emails himself the most interesting stories. That begins the process of choosing the 90 or so stories from The Times and Sunday Times that will populate the next issue. </p>
<p>&#8220;We’re trying to think about what we offer that you don’t get in other publications,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/petren">Nick Petrie</a>, The Times&#8217; deputy head of digital. &#8220;What stories have we covered particularly well? What stories have a London or U.K. angle and provide something you might not have gotten from your go-to, day-to-day publication?&#8221;</p>
<p>The app debuted last month in 46 countries. It&#8217;s only available on iOS for now but will eventually expand to Android as well. A subscription is $3.99 per month after a month-long free trial.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/TimesOfLondonWeekly.jpeg" alt="TimesOfLondonWeekly" width="300" height="518" class="nakedrightimage" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" />The weekly app is an interesting addition to The Times&#8217; core business model, and the paper&#8217;s digital staff plans to use some of the back-end tools it&#8217;s developing for the app for other projects down the line.</p>
<p>The Times of London, which is owned by <a href="https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch">Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s</a> News Corp, has a hard paywall. The Times makes it practically impossible to read its journalism for free. Readers have to sign in if they want to access stories from the papers&#8217; homepage or social media feeds. </p>
<p>The Times has <a href="http://www.inma.org/blogs/conference/post.cfm/hard-paywall-takes-the-times-from-loss-to-profit">170,000 digital-only subscribers</a>, and in 2014 it posted its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/dec/02/times-newspapers-posts-17m-profit-first-in-13-years">first profit</a> in more than a decade. </p>
<p>Petrie wouldn&#8217;t share how many people have subscribed to the weekly international edition, but The Times expects business and sports stories to be especially popular since London is a global financial center and the <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/">Premier League</a> has a worldwide following. </p>
<p>The app fits in with The Times&#8217; strategy of focusing on finite, finish-able products, from a daily <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/digital/">tablet app</a> to its website.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/DeathOfCrossing.jpeg" alt="DeathOfCrossing" width="300" height="534" class="nakedleftimage" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" />&#8220;We&#8217;re pursuing the idea of editions everywhere,&#8221; Petrie said. &#8220;An edition is something that can be finished. When you&#8217;ve read it, you feel up-to-date; you&#8217;ve been told what you need to know for the day or the week. The weekly app takes that idea as well. This idea will appear in more and more of our products as time goes on because it&#8217;s resonated so well with our readership.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a challenge to pick stories that will remain relevant up to a week after they were first published. It&#8217;s also potentially difficult to keep up with the news cycle: When David Bowie died earlier this month on a Monday, much of The Times&#8217; more in-depth coverage was published in the following Sunday&#8217;s paper, which was too late to make that week&#8217;s Weekly edition. </p>
<p>The Times might eventually write original stories for the weekly app. For fast-moving stories, like the presidential primaries, it might do a write-through that ties multiple stories together. It&#8217;s planning to add video and other visual elements, too.</p>
<p>For now, though, the process begins with those emails that Jacobson begins sending himself on Thursday mornings. The stories then have to be copied and pasted into the editor that The Times built for the app. </p>
<p>The editor was built on WordPress and has two main sections. The first is a dashboard that shows how many stories have been added and the time until the app&#8217;s deadline. The other half of the tool is where each edition of the app is actually built. When editors add headlines, body text, and photos, the software mimics what users will ultimately see in the app or on the web, where users can share stories that can be accessed for free. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/TimesOfLondonWeb.jpg" alt="TimesOfLondonWeb" width="600" height="562" class="nakedboxedimage" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve attempted to model this visually as close to the app as possible, so you literally feel like you&#8217;re building the real edition,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishutchinson">Chris Hutchinson</a>, The Times developer who built the editor said.</p>
<p>Within the next few weeks, The Times plans to introduce <a href="https://medium.com/digital-times/how-the-wordpress-rest-api-is-changing-the-way-we-tell-stories-770b767c4cac#.9v71xewny">a more automated system</a> that will pull from the paper&#8217;s recently launched content API and autofill everything into the editor, Hutchinson said. He plans to create a Google Chrome extension that will let editors automatically import a story&#8217;s details into the editor, along with notes about why they picked a story, and changes they&#8217;d like to make. </p>
<p>The Times also publishes on Apple News (it&#8217;s actually one of the few places where you can read its stories for free).  Hutchinson said that as the weekly app&#8217;s processes are automated, he plans to merge the feed used to power Apple News with the one that provides stories for the app.</p>
<p>Editors will still be able to alter headlines, add in new images, or change any other details to suit the articles for the app. The Times also plans to use the editor for other projects, and it wants to maintain the ability to create articles from scratch if necessary. &#8220;It&#8217;s really important for us to be able to tailor the article to the particular platform,&#8221; Hutchinson said. </p>
<p>The Times&#8217; developers also think about ease of use for staff. Last year, for example, they <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/its-journalism-is-behind-a-paywall-but-the-times-of-londons-developers-embrace-open-source/">developed a series of tools</a> to make it easier for journalists to create things such as newsletters, charts, and social media cards. That&#8217;s the approach The Times took with the editor tool for the weekly app as well.</p>
<p>As the paper continues to experiment with new formats — new proprietary apps, Apple News, Facebook Instant Articles, or whatever social platform is next — the developers want the paper&#8217;s decisions to be made on the merits of the journalism itself and whether it&#8217;s the right way to reach readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having good, stable bases like this will mean that we can make better decisions about how we choose to publish editions in the future,&#8221; Hutchinson said, &#8220;and where we choose to publish them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clashes over budget spending and expansion efforts appear to be at the root of the leadership upheaval. Politico is based in Washington, D.C., but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/politico-expansion-states-capitals-2020_us_56058da0e4b0768126fd652f">has been launching outposts</a> across the U.S. and into Europe.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/01/politico-robert-allbritton-memo-218363">dueling</a> <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/01/politico-jim-vandehei-memo-218364#ixzz3yasu3DfI">memos</a> posted to Politico&#8217;s site, VandeHei and Politico founder and publisher <a href="https://twitter.com/r_allbritton">Robert Allbritton</a> both credited the many people responsible for the organization&#8217;s rapid rise and expansion in its nine years of existence, while offering tiny bits of information on what&#8217;s to come for Politico and for the still-unnamed new venture VandeHei plans to start after his departure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/business/media/politico-mike-allen-jim-vandehei-leaving.html">The New York Times reported</a> that VandeHei is starting the new company with Allen and Schwartz, who was a driving force behind the high-end subscription business Politico Pro that now makes up <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_profile/can_politico_rise_again.php">approaching half Politico&#8217;s revenue</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jim VandeHei tells Politico staff he&#39;s going to start a new business then wants to go into public service.</p>
<p>&mdash; Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanByers/status/693113872929071104">January 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As VandeHei wrote in his memo to explain the timing of his departure:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, I caught the entrepreneurial bug a decade ago when we started this place and can&#8217;t seem to shake it. There is no greater challenge than trying to match in a new space the magic and success we pulled off here. This moment in media and in history is putting every sector and idea in play — and it is too intriguing and wide open to play it safe. I plan to start a new venture when I depart.</p>
<p>Second, and as important, I can leave now knowing a template for growth has been set, a first-class leadership team assembled and prepared for this transition, and POLITICO is powerful and durable enough to outlast us all. The true measure of business success is building a company that can prosper when the founders go. We stocked the place with talent during the past three years, in anticipation of this moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allbritton&#8217;s memo set up the exodus as a long time coming:</p>
<blockquote><p>These transitions make perfect sense for the publication, coming a decade (almost to the day) after I recruited them to join this cause. Jim in particular began signaling to me some years ago that he hoped the next stop in his career would be to once again start a new venture. Mike has launched and maintained the Playbook franchise — 365 days a year — longer than seemed humanly possible&#8230;.</p>
<p>What I have said to my leadership team is something I want to emphasize I’ll say to all of our nearly 500 POLITICO employees (a total ten times what we had at our launch): We are about to experience the most exciting, and I expect most enjoyable, period of expansion in ten years. With our revenue rapidly expanding, I am eager to make robust new investments in editorial quality, in technology, in business talent, and in new markets that we have not yet conquered.</p></blockquote>
<p>Staffers who spoke to other media outlets painted a picture of tension and unease. One unidentified source, for instance, told The Huffington Post that &#8220;Robert had enough with them spending shitloads of money.&#8221; And over at CNN, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/28/media/jim-vandehei-mike-allen-politico/">Dylan Byers wrote</a> that &#8220;[i]n recent years&#8230;Politico was plagued by what several insiders described as a crisis of vision and a leadership void.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last fall, an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/politico-expansion-states-capitals-2020_us_56058da0e4b0768126fd652f">internal memo</a> by VandeHei and editor-in-chief John Harris outlined Politico&#8217;s ambitions to be a &#8220;journalistic presence in every capital of every state and country of consequence by 2020. With each passing month, we grow more confident our model can save journalism in state capitals and spread it in new countries.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">POLITICO publisher on <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeallen">@mikeallen</a>&#39;s Playbook: &quot;The only way to replace a one-man army is with an army, so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do.&quot;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://codastory.com/">Coda Story</a> homepage is a busy place — filled to the corners, literally, with stories exploring different facets of Russia&#8217;s war on LGBTQ rights. There&#8217;s a video profile of a transgender woman living in Georgia. There&#8217;s a collection of intimate portraits of the LGBTQ community in Armenia&#8217;s capital city. There&#8217;s an overview of the Kremlin&#8217;s public stance on gay rights.</p>
<p>Coda Story is a &#8220;single-issue web platform,&#8221; as its team describes it, and it was built to capture all the geopolitical and economic undercurrents that contribute to the bubbling-over of a conflict: to &#8220;stay on the story&#8221; after the news cycle has largely moved on. At the moment, the nonprofit is in the first month of a three-month pilot to cover LGBTQ rights in Russia as thoroughly and continuously as possible. Readers can view pieces such as the <a href="http://codastory.com/lgbt-crisis/bianka">video of the transgender woman</a> within the context of overarching themes. These main themes are displayed as <a href="http://www.codastory.com/currents">&#8220;Currents,&#8221;</a> a framework designed to help readers visualize trend lines as stories are published to the site.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Coda-Story-currents-screenshot.png" alt="Coda-Story-currents-screenshot" width="300" height="auto" class="nakedleftimage" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to test the process of running a full Coda deployment — of being live online, updating the stories, commissioning stories, and so on,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/antelava?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natalia Antelava</a>, Coda Story co-founder and a long-time correspondent for the BBC. &#8220;A big reason we picked the topic of gay rights in Russia is that we felt it would play into the strength of Coda&#8217;s editorial approach, where you take a very narrow focus but use that as a window into much bigger issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>This editorial approach has been incubating for quite some time: In collaboration with user-experience design firm Method (which offered its services free), the Coda team developed the &#8220;Currents&#8221; tool as well as a specific visual identity to win <a href="https://twitter.com/CodaStory/status/477499305050525696">&#8220;best news startup&#8221; at the Global Editors Network summit</a> in the summer of 2014. The online platform itself, called <a href="https://codex.press/">Codex Press</a>, was created by web developer <a href="https://twitter.com/twfarnam">Tim Farnam</a>, a former Washington Post staff writer.</p>
<p>Coda launched a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/coda-reinventing-crisis-reporting--2#/">crowdfunding campaign</a> in December to match a foundation grant it had received, and ended up raising an additional $23,000 from 191 backers. Most of the funders were from the U.S., some were from continental Europe, and a smaller number from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, and other countries from the former Soviet Union. </p>
<p>In the case of LGBTQ rights in Russia, Antelava hopes the stories will attract two different sets of readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This pilot is definitely something that will be of interest to the LGBTQ community around the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we want to make it just as interesting for anyone who wants to understand this part of the world, or wants to understand Putin, or wants to understand what&#8217;s happening in Eastern Ukraine. It&#8217;s a niche audience, but in this case, we&#8217;ve covered potentially two niches.&#8221;</p>
<p>This echoes the line of thinking espoused by <a href="https://twitter.com/lara">Lara Setrakian</a>, founder and executive editor of the single-subject &#8220;Deeply&#8221; sites (Syria Deeply, Ebola Deeply, Water Deeply, Arctic Deeply).</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be covering species-level issues,&#8221; Setrakian <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/the-news-deeply-teams-latest-single-subject-site-offers-on-the-ground-coverage-of-arctic-issues/">told me recently</a>. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a species-level issue, and we&#8217;re not seeing it adequately covered in the news cycle, that makes it a candidate &#8230; The most important thing is choosing one and focusing on execution until we find that it&#8217;s reached an adequate level of development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coda&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;stay on the story&#8221; after mainstream media leaves a crisis region, but how will it convince readers to come back to the issues it&#8217;s so painstakingly covering?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not in the business of flogging dead horses. We pick crises that are consequential and complex, and that can&#8217;t be understood through sporadic flashes of attention,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/AbbieFS">Abigail Fielding-Smith</a>, Coda Story&#8217;s chief content officer, said. &#8220;It&#8217;s less about persuading the readers to keep following a particular topic for a length of time, and more about making sure we keep bringing them stuff that is as interesting as the crisis is. The more invested you are in something, the more interesting it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site features pieces written by the <a href="http://www.codastory.com/about">small Coda Story team</a>, as well as contributions from freelancers and other journalists. It has an editorial partnership and content exchange with news and analysis site <a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/">EurasiaNet</a> and can tap into that site&#8217;s large network of writers on the ground.</p>
<p>Still, with a limited staff, the site won&#8217;t be trying to keep up with breaking news.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to watch things unfurl at the pace of evolving trends rather than daily developments,&#8221; Fielding-Smith said. &#8220;But, of course, timeliness is key to impact. Our social media people are monitoring news developments and using them as pegs to push our content with. And we&#8217;ll be hopefully anticipating developments, doing reporting that complements the news cycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antelava stresses this is still just a pilot. &#8220;We are constantly talking to people about story ideas or what can be done differently, where we can contribute a perspective or a new angle or maybe have a bit of a scoop.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the short term, the team will continue to rely on the initial burst of foundation and crowdfunding money; the editorial commitment is three months. In the long run, though, Coda Story will explore other revenue streams, including licensing its editorial methods to other groups looking to cover a specific issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times already has the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manohla_Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movies/critics/A-O-Scott">A.O. Scott</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/poniewozik">James Poniewozik</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wesley_morris">Wesley Morris</a> on staff, directing our tastes and opinions of movies, television shows, and a range of cultural and pop cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>But as familiar boundaries erode (are we supposed to call a Netflix or Amazon series a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/arts/television/streaming-tv-isnt-just-a-new-way-to-watch-its-a-new-genre.html">&#8220;TV show&#8221;?</a>) and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/31/netflix-vs-amazon-in-2015-a-tale-of-two-video-streaming-giants/">original programming</a> from various video streaming services explodes, the Times is looking to offer a little extra guidance on what movies and shows readers should be (binge)watching now. It&#8217;s part of the paper&#8217;s efforts to build digital revenue through more and better service journalism, in this case tackling the question: <em>What to do when there&#8217;s too much good stuff to watch?</em></p>
<p>What will the new product look like? At the moment, most of what we have to go on are <a href="http://www.nytco.com/careers/Newsroom/#12716">job postings</a> for the product&#8217;s staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New York Times is launching a film and TV recommendation tool which will help users make sense of the ever more complex streaming video landscape. The product’s focus will be service-based and distinct from the criticism and coverage in our daily report; its goals will be to help users decide what movies and TV shows are worth their limited time, and make it easy for them to find and watch them. The product will roll out in two stages — there will first be a several-times-weekly newsletter, followed by a full website with daily content. It will be a product for movie and TV obsessives and we’d love to have movie and TV obsessives working on the product.</p></blockquote>
<p>(The job descriptions also include a bonus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwS66EBUcY">Bonnie Tyler</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film)"><em>Footloose</em></a> reference.)</p>
<p>The newsletter is &#8220;soon-to-be launched,&#8221; with the full website to follow this summer, one job posting says. It appears the content of both would be responsive to broader events:</p>
<blockquote><p>What are the best David Bowie movies currently streaming? What are the seasons of the West Wing to check out if I’ve never seen the show before? What should be my next binge-watching obsession?</p>
<p>These are the types of questions the new TV and movie product hopes to answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>With its new film and TV site, The Times is looking to replicate the audience success of its functional and free cooking site (and accompanying app), NYT Cooking, which debuted in 2014. When I asked a Times spokesperson for more information about the vertical, I was referred to the <a href="http://www.nytco.com/wp-content/uploads/Our-Path-Forward.pdf">extensive digital strategy memo</a> released last October:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our readers turn to The Times for more than just news and entertainment. They turn to us to help them make decisions in their daily lives. The newspaper has always provided a significant service role — helping readers decide what show to see, what book to read and what apartment to buy — and we believe we can add even more value on mobile. The effort to modernize our service journalism began with Cooking a year ago. Our goal was to use our content and expertise to address a specific need for our readers: what to cook for dinner. With almost five million monthly users, Cooking has been so popular with readers that we are expanding this service approach to other areas starting with real estate, health, and film and television. Together these efforts aim to reimagine our features sections for the mobile era with the same vigor and creativity that we put into launching them in the 1970s.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Times has launched a few other well-loved digital products in the past couple of years, but monetizing them hasn&#8217;t been as easy. Last May, the Times made its smartphone app NYT Now free to all users, having captured <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2015/04/8565393/emtimesem-plans-make-nyt-now-mobile-app-free">only around 20,000 signups</a>. The dedicated NYT Opinion app shuttered within four months of launching in June 2014, after it wasn&#8217;t able to get enough people to pay $6 every four weeks for the product. As <a href="https://twitter.com/andyrnyt">Andy Rosenthal</a>, editorial page editor for the Times, told the Lab:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It wasn’t getting a new group of readers in the same way that Now does,” he said. “The sheer volume of people looking at it wasn’t enough to sustain it.” The app pushed Times writing and columns into new territory and made the opinion staff more innovative, he said. “This is not us saying it didn’t work as a journalistic venture; it did,” Rosenthal said. “It’s just not working as a business.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For its film and TV recommendation site, the Times is looking for one movie and one TV writer, a photo editor, and staff editors, according to the job listings. The writers &#8220;should be able to write concise, casually authoritative prose focused primarily on recommending things that Times readers should or should not watch.&#8221; </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Economist is publishing charts and other visual content on messaging app Line, the company announced this week. The Economist already promotes its bilingual English-Chinese app, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/04/newsonomics-why-the-economist-decided-nows-the-time-to-speak-chinese/">The Economist Global Business Review</a>, on WeChat in China, but it&#8217;s the first time the company is experimenting with a messaging app outside that country.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Love our charts? They are now available in instant messages <a href="https://t.co/WoWtg8O5Cg">https://t.co/WoWtg8O5Cg</a> <a href="https://t.co/bKZNxM6muy">pic.twitter.com/bKZNxM6muy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The Economist (@ECONdailycharts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ECONdailycharts/status/692426440940351488">January 27, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly messaging apps are where social media is going next, and we and other publishers need to figure them out,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstandage">Tom Standage</a>, deputy editor of The Economist, told me.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/IMG_5097.jpg" alt="IMG_5097" width="300" height="440" class="nakedrightimage" style="border: 1px solid lightgrey;" />Why choose the Japan-based Line over a more globally popular messaging app like <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> or <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">Facebook Messenger</a>? Standage said that the app&#8217;s audience is &#8220;complementary&#8221; to The Economist&#8217;s existing Facebook and Twitter audiences. It also supports both bots and conversational interfaces, &#8220;which is something we plan to experiment with this year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously there will be more support for publishers on Messenger and WhatsApp in the future, but Line is further along in that regard, which means we can get started now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Line had 215 million monthly active users <a href="http://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2016/1223">as of the end of 2015</a>, with 67 percent of those coming from Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia. (The Facebook-owned WhatsApp, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jan.koum/posts/10153580960970011">has nearly a billion monthly active users</a>.) But Line is unique among messaging apps in that it pulls in a lot of revenue from sales of stickers, books, games, and ads — it pulled in ¥120.7 billion (US$1.02 billion) in revenue in 2015.</p>
<p>The company has also expanded into news and media in Asia. From its 2015 <a href="http://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2016/1223">year-end earnings report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LINE NEWS, a news distribution service available in Japan, has successfully launched the “LINE Account Media Platform,” a new service which allows external media outlets to distribute news by creating an Official Account. LINE NEWS topped 22 million monthly active users in December 2015. LINE LIVE, a new live streaming platform that provides live video and programming free of charge, launched on December 10, 2015 and received more than 11 million unique viewers in its first month. Both of these services are exhibiting strong growth immediately after their respective launches. Meanwhile, the video-on-demand service LINE TV available in Taiwan and Thailand is steadily increasing users by offering more and more dramas and variety programs that suit the tastes of the respective regions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other English-language news outlets — including The Wall Street Journal, BuzzFeed, the BBC, TechCrunch, and Mashable — are also on Line.</p>
<p>In addition to charts, The Economist will also experiment with posting photos of the day, quotes, and video to its Line account. Line provided clear directions on which aspect ratio is optimal for push messages and its homepage, said Denise Law, The Economist&#8217;s deputy community editor, &#8220;so we worked with our designers to build templates that would enable us to promote charts more effectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, The Economist plans to publish 4 to 6 pieces per day to its Line homepage, and to send two or three push notifications per week, said Law, &#8220;including a preview of our cover, breaking news blogs, explainers, and articles from our [morning briefing] <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2014/11/economist-espresso">Espresso</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to be able to apply what we learn from publishing on Line to other platforms,&#8221; Standage said. &#8220;<a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> seems like a particularly good platform on which to experiment with bots, and Snapchat is coming up the field fast. The challenge for us, and for other publishers, is not just to figure out what works best on each platform, but also to decide which platforms to focus on and how to allocate our resources between them.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Political ad dollars have been a boon for local TV stations for decades. Will local news outlets still be able to capture that money as political advertising moves to digital?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/pca-700x475.png" alt="pca" width="250" height="auto" class="nakedrightimage" />That&#8217;s a question that the <a href="http://www.pca.io/">Programming Corporation of America (PCA)</a> aims to help answer. A network of local filmmakers spread across the United States, the PCA wants to produce &#8220;high quality, high interest, and infinitely local&#8221; video that can slot into the websites and apps of local newspapers and TV stations, building a revenue-sharing model that could pull in digital money that would otherwise go to national outlets or social networks.</p>
<p>PCA, which will celebrate its first anniversary next week — fittingly, the exact day is February 1, the date of the Iowa caucus — came together through the talents of several filmmaker alumni of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_TV">Current TV</a>. &#8220;There&#8217;s a little bit of pre-history to PCA,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabeckmann">Daniel Beckmann</a>, the founder of PCA and a former creative lead at Current. This community was invaluable to setting up PCA, both because of shared experience and shared values, Beckmann says. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of reasons why Current didn&#8217;t work out, but this model of production isn&#8217;t why,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We believe it&#8217;s important to pay living wages and that they [the filmmakers] get creative control. We use fewer people, but it&#8217;s work for professional rates.&#8221; </p>
<p>PCA&#8217;s products are series of local, one-minute videos. Seeing an opportunity in the political ad dollars flooding the nation&#8217;s early primary states, PCA set up shop in Iowa and New Hampshire and created <a href="http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/">Iowa Originals</a> and <a href="http://nhoriginals.pca.io/">New Hampshire Originals</a>. In both markets, they partnered with and then distributed their video online through local news outlets. In Iowa, this meant working with the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/">Des Moines Register</a>, and in New Hampshire, with television station <a href="http://www.wmur.com/">WMUR in Manchester</a>. &#8220;These places have been in the community for a long time. They are good local newsrooms and we wanted to work with places with credibility,&#8221; says Beckmann. The collaboration extends upwards: PCA is partnered with Gannett (which owns the Register) and Hearst (the parent company of WMUR). While the videos are all shot on location, PCA maintains offices in New York and San Francisco, where Beckmann is based, for some post-production needs. </p>
<p>The video series have a vast array of subject matter, some state-specific, some less so. There&#8217;s <a href="http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/series/iowa-guy-in-new-york">Iowa Guy in New York</a>, in which a host asks unsuspecting New Yorkers Iowa-themed questions like <a href="http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/series/iowa-guy-in-new-york/videos/dan-gable-or-brad-pitt">&#8220;Brad Pitt or Dan Gable?&#8221;</a> or <a href="http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/series/iowa-guy-in-new-york/videos/hawkeye">&#8220;What is a hawkeye?&#8221;</a> (&#8220;That comic book guy with the arrows&#8221; says one respondent, which, while true, is also wrong.) There&#8217;s also <a href="http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/series/99-counties-in-iowa">99 Counties</a>, a series in which the filmmakers visit the best thing in each of Iowa&#8217;s counties as determined by locals. In New Hampshire, the series <a href="http://nhoriginals.pca.io/series/five-things-new-hampshire">5 Things New Hampshire</a> includes episodes like <a href="http://nhoriginals.pca.io/series/five-things-new-hampshire/videos/white-birch">&#8220;Things You Never Knew About the White Birch Tree&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://nhoriginals.pca.io/series/five-things-new-hampshire/videos/inventors">&#8220;NH-born Inventors.&#8221;</a> Hard news this ain&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Between the two states, there&#8217;s also a fair amount of overlap in series formats. That&#8217;s intentional, says Beckmann: &#8220;While still doing stories that are local, we want a replicable ideas that we can expand with.&#8221; These serialized series include <a href="http://nhoriginals.pca.io/series/let-s-eat-new-hampshire">Let&#8217;s Eat!</a>, a restaurant review show, and <a href="http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/series/cold-and-alone">Cold and Alone</a>, which is technically known as <a href="http://nhoriginals.pca.io/series/barefoot-and-alone/">Barefoot and Alone</a> in New Hampshire, when presumably it was filmed in better weather. </p>
<p><iframe src='http://iowaoriginals.pca.io/videos/arrival/video_embed_iframe'  width='100%' height='540' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In the run-up to an early presidential primary or caucus, local audiences are swamped with political advertising. A recent <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-iowa-family-drowning-in-campaign-ads/">FiveThirtyEight</a> article followed one Iowan family as they counted the number of political advertisements they came across in one day — around 90, or five per waking hour. Political ad spending on television has totaled <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/total-amount-spent-campaign-ads-iowa-n504506">more than $70 million</a> in Iowa alone. In producing one-minute video, PCA is providing an opportunity for advertisers to show their ad every minute. &#8220;Not to give the secret sauce away, but with preroll ads, you get paid the same amount regardless of how long the video lasts,&#8221; says Beckmann. I saw the same Bernie Sanders ad on PCA videos about 10 times before I got a new advertisement, and because you have to pause the video or click out before the very end when the ad takes over, I saw it as both a preroll and postroll.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to imagine how the additional content to sop up the massive influx of online ad spending would be interesting to the newsrooms with whom PCA has partnered. Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/digital-politcal-ads-2016/">reported</a> last year that over $1 billion is expected to be spent on online ads alone in the 2016 election cycle, a roughly 5,000 percent increase over what was spent in 2012. It&#8217;s a trend that is expected to only grow in the future. </p>
<p>Beckmann sees this and the partnerships created with local newsrooms as a way to bolster profits and add an additional revenue stream. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing something the Des Moines Register and WMUR aren&#8217;t doing. Most of our shows aren&#8217;t newsy — they are more like features,&#8221; he says. The PCA videos are presented with a wrapper that makes them look like they&#8217;re on the WMUR or Des Moines Register websites; the ad revenue is shared between the partners. &#8220;We hope we&#8217;re providing more revenue to traditional news media,&#8221; says Beckmann. &#8220;We&#8217;re not trying to replace them or even disrupt them. They are the last people trying to do this work, and if we can provide revenue that&#8217;s not a risk to them, then that&#8217;s a happy family.&#8221; So far, says Beckmann, PCA has sold out its advertising space most days of the week.</p>
<p>Continuing to work productively with local partners is a critical part of PCA&#8217;s plan for expansion. PCA will be next expanding to <a href="http://scoriginals.pca.io/">South Carolina</a>, Florida, and Nevada, all before each state&#8217;s primary. </p>
<p><iframe src='http://nhoriginals.pca.io/videos/earth-eagle-brewings/video_embed_iframe' width='100%' height='540' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The obvious problem with relying on enormous local political spending is that, eventually, election day comes. Not many campaigns will be interested in reaching Iowa voters the day after Monday&#8217;s caucuses. Beckmann hopes, by the time PCA is in 12 state markets, it will be able to attract national ad buys. There&#8217;s also the possibility of producing series specifically targeting demographics in which advertisers have indicated interest. &#8220;If they want to reach a certain demographic, they can pay us to develop a series. We&#8217;ll come up with the show and they buy the series,&#8221; he says. In Florida, PCA is currently developing a series called Fountain of Youth asking senior citizens what their secret to life is. It could be a candidate for an advertiser looking to reach that demographic. There may also be a possibility to continue seeking political ad dollars; though presidential election years bring the truly huge budgets, there are still senate campaigns, ballot initiatives, and other political races, Beckmann says.</p>
<p>Of course, to command national ad buys, PCA will also have to prove that it has an audience. Independent watch counts were not available for its video, and while each video invites you to share it on social, I <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&#038;vertical=default&#038;q=nhoriginals%20OR%20iowaoriginals&#038;src=typd">found very few links</a> having been shared on Facebook or Twitter, even by PCA&#8217;s partners. PCA itself and the two state sites also aren&#8217;t <a href="https://twitter.com/NHorig">particularly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/IowaOrig">active</a> on social media. While this in itself is proof of nothing, it suggests PCA will need to develop its distribution strategy. </p>
<p>The rest of 2016 will be spent building a name for PCA, Beckmann says. &#8220;We&#8217;re going door to door like Chris Christie, and like him, people will decide if they like us.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been about a year since the Berkman Center at Harvard launched, in beta, a tool called Amber that helps preserve copies of every page linked to on a website. It&#8217;s an important project because, as we <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/02/amber-a-new-tool-to-prevent-linkrot-on-websites-is-out-in-beta/">wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Broken links are] a problem for anyone who publishes on the web, but particularly for news organizations — both because that network of links is an important part of the historical record and because so many news site redesigns and CMS changes have killed a disproportionate share of the web’s URLs.</p></blockquote>
<p>A 2013 study <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/politics/in-supreme-court-opinions-clicks-that-lead-nowhere.html?_r=0">found</a> that 49 percent of links in Supreme Court decisions were dead, for instance (and the percentage is no doubt higher now), while more than 100,000 Wikipedia articles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_dead_external_links">contain dead external links</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/99276">On Thursday</a>, Berkman made <a href="http://amberlink.org/">Amber</a> available to everyone as a plugin for WordPress and a module for Drupal. </p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/25Kz7PqapG4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The podcasting fervor of 2015 has continued into 2016 and shows no signs of diminishing. Gimlet, the podcast startup cofounded by <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/gimlet-wants-to-become-the-hbo-of-podcasting-heres-what-its-founders-learned-trying-to-get-there/">Alex Blumberg of Planet Money</a> and public radio fame, is a household name in the digital audio world. Swedish-born podcasting platform <a href="https://www.acast.com/">Acast</a>, now in the U.S., <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054877/most-creative-people/beyond-mail-kimp-the-future-of-podcast-advertising">has ambitions to broaden dramatically</a> the podcasting world. Public radio <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/hot-pod-why-is-wnyc-making-such-a-big-bet-on-podcasts/">isn&#8217;t missing out</a> <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/11/nprs-new-podcast-concierge-recommends-shows-from-inside-and-outside-public-radio/">on podcasting</a>. There&#8217;s money to be made through a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/hot-pod-mailchimp-tries-a-new-ad-strategy-behind-a-paywall/">premium subscription service for podcasts</a>.</p>
<p>Podcasting is also a welcoming format, requiring little more than a microphone and a server to host files. While companies like Gimlet are churning out shiny high quality shows — including <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/sampler/">a new podcast about podcasts</a> — newspapers are also dipping their toes into more elaborate audio stories to reach new audiences, and to just try their hand at a still-growing medium.</p>
<p>When Serial came out, &#8220;everyone in our newsroom&#8230;[was] taken by that narrative storytelling format and realized just how powerful a tool podcasting can be,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonnobleDMR">Jason Noble</a>, a political reporter at the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/">Des Moines Register</a>, said. Noble hosts <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/09/30/three-tickets-iowa-caucuses-podcast-debut-oct-8/73103038/">Three Tickets</a>, a podcast about the Iowa presidential caucuses. It&#8217;s one of many podcasts <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/hot-pod-charting-the-outflow-of-public-radio-talent-to-the-new-for-profit-podcast-industry/">launched to fit into the election cycle</a>.</p>
<p>Several other reporters-cum-podcasters also acknowledged their debt to Serial, which is now deep into its second season. Last year, the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> finished up the first season of a series called <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/introducing-breakdown-new-podcast-series-ajc/nk9sx/">Breakdown</a>, about a Georgia man convicted of murder and the team convinced he&#8217;s innocent. <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/">The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</a> just wrapped up a seven-part series called <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/introducing-breakdown-new-podcast-series-ajc/nk9sx/">Unsolved</a> (also <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/Unsolved-A-murdered-teen-a-40-year-mystery-340018662.html">elaborately presented on the web</a>), about an unsolved homicide from 40 years earlier, that landed near the top of the iTunes charts.</p>
<p>I spoke to several people working on new (and newish) podcasts for their news organizations. We talked about production challenges, how the audio content interacts with print and web, figuring out their audiences, and more. Their responses, below, are condensed and lightly edited.</p>
<h3 class="subhead"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/presidential-podcast/">Presidential</a>, from The Washington Post</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lily_cunningham">Lillian Cunningham</a>, editor and feature writer of the Post&#8217;s &#8216;On Leadership&#8217; section:</p>
<p>I wonder if we’re being helped by the fact that in <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial season two, the Bowe Bergdahl story</a> is not true crime-related the way season one was, yet a lot of people are still interested in the type of storytelling in the first season. We always tried to have a national angle. My hope was that it wouldn&#8217;t really matter to people where this happened — it&#8217;s just an interesting story with universal themes that people could relate to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten emails from people in other states who are just discovering this. Listeners and audience members ask when we&#8217;re doing season two. Through various channels (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3ri72w/unsolved_the_search_for_john_zeras_killer_a/">including a mention on Reddit</a>), we were able to reach the audience that is interested in following our stories in the audio format.</p>
<p>We’ve put it up online and put blurbs in the paper. When the paper version ran, we had our own shortcut online to the podcast audio page, so that people could go directly to that if they wanted to. We were also promoting separately on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p>
<p>We cooperated with our <a href="http://wuwm.com/post/journal-sentinel-wraps-unsolved-series-now">local NPR station WUWM</a>: They’ve done two interviews with me throughout the course of this series; they were promoting the project on their site as well. In February, the 40th anniversary of John Zera&#8217;s death, they’ll air the entire podcast series. The plan is, if the case is solved, we’ll do one more episode on it. Even if they don’t solve it, we&#8217;re thinking of doing an update then.</div></p>
<h3 class="subhead">Breakdown, from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</h3>
<p><a href="<a href="http://www.ajc.com/staff/bill-rankin/">Bill Rankin</a>, senior legal affairs writer:</p>
<p><div class="conr">It was after Thanksgiving, during the first season of Serial: My managing editor&#8217;s son, who is a public defender, told him to listen to Serial. He came back and asked my editor, Richard Halicks, whether we could do something like that.</p>
<p>I had this case that I’d been reading about already, because so many people had been contacting me about it. It was the <a href="http://legal.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/10/justin-chapmans-murder-arson-case-to-get-new-look/">Justin Chapman case</a>. Litigator Mike Caplan, who represented Chapman and is featured in several episodes of the podcast, told me he thought the man was innocent. That obviously got my attention. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Breakdown-AJC-screenshot.jpg" alt="Breakdown-AJC-screenshot" width="300" height="auto" class="nakedleftimage" /></p>
<p>Finally, I finished reading everything and interviewing everyone — I was covering a trial at the time, and I couldn’t do this particular case right away, but in my spare time I was reading all the transcripts and court files and getting up to speed on this case, which I was fascinated by. It had all sorts of problems every step of the way.</p>
<p>We had an editorial meeting, and I remember being asked if I was willing to do this story as a podcast. I said okay, though I had no idea. I&#8217;d never done anything even remotely like that — I’m a print journalist. I was taken off the trial I&#8217;d been covering and spent nearly six months working on the podcast.</p>
<p>A lot of people worked on other parts of it. <a href="http://breakdown.myajc.com/">We made a special website for it</a>. [Editor] Richard and a producer worked on it with me. We had full editorial control; people trusted us to do it right. We hired a story consultant, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susannacapelouto">Susanna Capelouto</a>, who came from public radio — she was a longtime public radio reporter and broadcaster here in the Atlanta area. We hired a studio, Company 3 in Atlanta, and worked with their sound engineer. I learned a lot from him, and he made me sound <em>a lot</em> better.</p>
<p>Susanna told me very early on how important audio was. I needed to make &#8220;sound boards,&#8221; where I would get audio tape and listen to that tape and figure out the best parts and passages to use. I needed to take note of the timing when I wrote the script, so we would know exactly where we needed to insert additional sound. That early advice was a big help.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve covered courts and legal affairs for a long time. When I told lawyers and judges I was doing this podcast, some of them didn’t even know what podcasts were — though it really wasn’t a problem after I explained it to them.</p>
<p>We went through a lot of trouble to get tapes of Chapman&#8217;s trial, to get tapes from the habeas hearing. The sound quality was not nearly as good as we wanted, so we tried to use it as sparsely as possible. You need to have great sound if you want to draw people in. You need good sound, you need good interviews, and all sorts of scene noise. </p>
<p>When we went on to write the script, we would write it the best we could. Then I&#8217;d quietly go somewhere and read it. I&#8217;d usually have to rewrite it. I&#8217;d have to enunciate certain phrases, different phrases, because when you finally read what you&#8217;ve written aloud, you realize it’s totally different. You have to be writing differently, because you’re speaking.</p>
<p>I’m not privy to all the numbers, but I know iTunes has a news and politics category, and [Breakdown] was in the top 100 when it was ongoing. We found that even after we stopped promoting the podcast, it still traveled around. And back in August we found a lot of people in other places listening to it; people in London, in Chicago. Obviously we’d like to have millions and millions of listeners like Serial had, but we had no idea what to expect. We’d never promoted anything like this before.</p>
<p>We got a really good reception from listeners, and we’re thinking of doing another one. And yes, I did get other tips during the course of this airing, and no, I can&#8217;t say what they are!</div></p>
<h3 class="subhead">Three Tickets, from the Des Moines Register</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonnobleDMR?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jason Noble</a>, political reporter:</p>
<p><div class="conr">This podcast came out of an informal conversation I had with my executive editor, Emily Nash. I&#8217;ve been covering presidential race for five years now, and one of the defining things about covering caucuses is: it&#8217;s windshield time. It&#8217;s a big state. What if I could get a newsmaker in the car with me, and we drove to Cedar Rapids for a political event, and I had this sort of longform interview in the car with them? That didn’t make a lot of sense for many reasons, but that’s sort of where we started from.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Three-Tickets-DMR-logo.jpg" alt="Three-Tickets-DMR-logo" width="300" height="auto" class="nakedleftimage" /></p>
<p>We wanted to consider how we could tell this story of the whole sweep of the history of the caucuses in a podcast. We came up with a general idea, and started reaching out to people. I had the opportunity to go to D.C. for a conference, and there I was able to schedule Joe Trippi and Bob Dole, and made those episodes as we went along.</p>
<p>I conduct all the interviews, transcribe the tape, figure out the story, write the voiceover, and give that whole package to a freelance engineer we hired. The engineer puts it into the software, adjusts the music, and we have an editing process back-and-forth.</p>
<p>I have to really credit my editors. I spent a good five or six months where I pretty much neglected everything else and just worked on this, and they were cool with it. They hired freelance engineer before there was any material, before we knew whether there could be a revenue component to this.</p>
<p><blockquote class="fullpullquote"><span data-pullquote="&#8220;I go into a lot of detail&#8230;When I can set it up in the podcast as conversation between me, as a narrator, and an expert, it engages your attention longer.&#8221;"></span></blockquote></p>
<p>From the start, I’ve conceived of this as a national product. I tried to balance who we talked to: some national names that everyone in the political word knows, some Iowans with really interesting histories. It’s the first time The Register has done a show that&#8217;s this produced, though some of our sports reporters have radio shows or a standing appearance on radio shows.</p>
<p>One of my favorite episodes is about how caucuses really work — the actual mechanics of it. I tell the story of the debacle of the 2012 caucuses [which involved a razor-thin victory and <a href="http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2012/01/19/register-exclusive-2012-gop-caucus-count-unresolved/">large-scale miscounts and missing data</a>]. I go into a lot of detail, <em>excruciating</em> detail, and there’s no way you could read that in print. It’d be so boring your eyes would glaze over. But when I can set it up in the podcast as conversation between me and an expert, it engages your attention longer.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Register-archives-screen.png" alt="Register-archives-screen" width="300" height="auto" class="nakedrightimage" /></p>
<p>I interviewed Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Matt Strawn, who gave me this wonderful interview. It was so reflective. He really took responsibility for how things went that night in January [at the 2012 Iowa caucuses]. The story was told in his voice. We told that story in the papers in 2012, but this was a definitive explanation of how that night unfolded.</p>
<p>The timing of this was important. We started releasing the podcast from October through December. The Iowa caucuses are on February 1. Then we&#8217;re not going to really exist anymore in the same way for another two or three years. I wanted to have the series exist in its entirety before national interest vanishes.</p>
<p>When I first started the podcast, I got it into Politico&#8217;s Playbook. I’ve done quite a lot of radio interviews, local and elsewhere. I’ve done an interview for Sirius FM — they had me on for about ten minutes to talk about the podcast. The audience challenge was a big one: how to get it in front of people, and also how to gauge success. We don&#8217;t have great metrics. But for me personally, this has been an incredibly fulfilling project, one of the most important gratifying things I’ve ever worked on as a journalist. There&#8217;s great potential for building out the Register’s audience.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t, in the end, sell the podcast. We had some discussions with Panoply and shared a few rough cuts with them, but in the end we had to move on because of our timeline. With a podcast, theoretically, there’s an advertising market. If I can somehow pioneer something at a Midwestern metropolitan paper, that would be great!</div></p>
