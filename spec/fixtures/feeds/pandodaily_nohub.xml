During this time, the company had elected not to pay rights holders any royalties, under the logic that if Apple wasn&#8217;t getting paid nobody would get paid.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Taylor Swift &#8212; <a href="http://pando.com/2014/11/03/how-bad-is-it-for-spotify-that-taylor-swift-pulled-all-her-songs/">who most recently flexed her muscles at streaming companies when she removed her catalog from Spotify</a> &#8212; <a href="http://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/122071902085/to-apple-love-taylor" target="_blank">wrote a Tumblr post</a> decrying Apple and announced that she would hold back her newest hit album, <em>1989</em>, from the streaming service unless it reversed course and paid artists during the trial period.</p> <p>&#8220;We don’t ask you for free iPhones,&#8221; Swift wrote. &#8220;Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.&#8221;</p> <p>At this point, it appeared that the argument was just another chapter in the battle between Taylor and the tech industry. Then late last night, Apple&#8217;s SVP of internet services and software Eddy Cue sent the following tweet:</p> <form id="wpcom-iframe-form-989bf82acd8d70bbc7baddb988c8d611-558849857e6ee" target="wpcom-iframe-989bf82acd8d70bbc7baddb988c8d611-558849857e6ee" method="post" action="//wpcomwidgets.com/?wpcom_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fpandodaily.wordpress.com" style="display: none"> <input type="hidden" name="width" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="height" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="frameborder" value="0" /> <input type="hidden" name="style" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="class" value="twitter-tweet" /> <input type="hidden" name="scrolling" value="no" /> <input type="hidden" name="webkitallowfullscreen" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="mozallowfullscreen" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="allowfullscreen" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="resize" value="0" /> <input type="hidden" name="replace_attributes" value="1" /> <input type="hidden" name="fallback" value="&#60;p class=&#34;protected-embed-fallback&#34;&#62;This embed is invalid&#60;/p&#62;" /> <input type="hidden" name="_data" value="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,92cd5ef1502a47b0d42cad087a7a056da78a686c" /> <input type="hidden" name="_tag" value="protected-iframe" /> <input type="hidden" name="_hash" value="989bf82acd8d70bbc7baddb988c8d611" /> </form> <iframe name="wpcom-iframe-989bf82acd8d70bbc7baddb988c8d611-558849857e6ee" id="wpcom-iframe-989bf82acd8d70bbc7baddb988c8d611-558849857e6ee" width="" height="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wpcom-protected-iframe twitter-tweet"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript"> ( function() { var func = function() { var iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-989bf82acd8d70bbc7baddb988c8d611-558849857e6ee');

to &#8220;It&#8217;s a win for artists!&#8221; to the least interesting of the three, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they used Tumblr and Twitter to broker a massive content deal!&#8221;</p> <p>But a few questions remain in the wake of all these good pro-Apple vibes &#8212; questions that, depending on the answers, make this feel like less of a win for creatives than many have made it out to be.</p> <p>First off, throughout the negotiations with record companies ahead of Apple Music&#8217;s launch, Apple was saddled by some fairly onerous and greed-driven demands from labels, <a href="http://pando.com/2015/06/07/can-apple-save-the-music-industry-from-the-destructive-greed-of-record-labels/">as I&#8217;ve detailed here</a>. As rights holders of this content, labels hold the power in these talks, and frankly Apple could dictate no terms of this deal without the permission of the labels. I mean, the deal almost fell apart in the eleventh hour over 5 percentage points! So while I don&#8217;t doubt that it was Apple&#8217;s choice to launch a trial period and to not pay artists during those three months, they did so with the blessing of the labels.</p> <p>I wonder, then, what Apple gave up to labels in return? Was it that increase in royalty payments of 5 percentage points? An increase that artists weren&#8217;t likely to see in their coffers anyway because labels already take such huge chunks of these payments? Did it have to do with the monthly rate, which Apple wanted to keep at a much more affordable &#8212; but still wildly lucrative for rights holders &#8212; $5 a month? But which Apple, at the behest of labels, made $10 a month, despite many observers being unconvinced that consumers will pay that much?</p> <p>Like most battles between creatives and tech corporations, this fight has been framed by many as operating in a vacuum between two opposing sides, while the people in the middle who work for record labels are ignored despite the fact that none of what Apple&#8217;s done here would have been possible without their consent. In fact, the tidiness of this resolution feels just a tad suspicious. I&#8217;m not saying that this fight was ginned up to draw positive attention toward Apple or Taylor Swift or both. But if it was, it would be pretty brilliant PR move.</p> <p>Whatever happened behind closed doors, the Apple Music-Taylor Swift fight feels like a less win for artists and more like a win for&#8230; Apple Music and Taylor Swift. Or for those other rare artists who possess enough control over their rights to dictate how and when their catalog is monetized and to secure a healthy percentage of that money for themselves. The truth is, most artists are forced to give up most of their royalties to labels and lack the luxury of removing their catalog from a streaming service if that service strikes a deal with labels that&#8217;s perceived to be unfair. And no, I don&#8217;t mean these artists lack the popularity to convince Apple to change its mind by withholding content. I mean they literally have no control over whether or not their music appears on Apple Music or not because that decision is made by their label &#8212; which I guess makes sense considering the label&#8217;s the one keeping most of the money.</p> <p>And so, no: This isn&#8217;t a big win for artists. For artists without Swift&#8217;s control, most of that extra money from the three-month period will go in the pockets of labels. Instead, it&#8217;s just another example of how the lack of transparency in content deals often screws over artists.</p> <p><em>[illustration by Brad Jonas]</em></p> <div id="author-info"> <h3>David Holmes</h3> <div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;"> <img width="86" height="100" src="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/studio20profile.jpg?w=86&#038;h=100" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Studio20profile" /> </div> <div>David Holmes is Pando's East Coast Editor.

Collections are available on Twitter&#8217;s website and its mobile applications, and are linked to their creators&#8217; profiles.</p> <p>Twitter is positioning the feature as a tool through which its users will be able to &#8220;browse rich collections from influencers [they] care about and get more information about the products or places [they] find interesting&#8221; on its service.</p> <p>Many of the collections posted so far, however, aren&#8217;t all that interesting at all. They&#8217;re just a bunch of tweets about products that Amanda Palmer or Target want you to discover, learn about, and ultimately purchase from their sites.</p> <p>Others are better. My favorite is <a href="https://twitter.com/wirecutter/timelines/609430446061948928" target="_blank">one posted by</a> the Wirecutter, which has collected links to what it considers the best travel gear, as determined by writers and researchers who spend a lot of time with each item.</p> <p>Indeed, even though this feature is being marketed as a tool that might be popular with celebrities or brands, it seems like publications stand the best chance of creating interesting collections because of their relative impartiality.</p> <p>But even those collections don&#8217;t do much to improve the experience of shopping on Twitter. It requires two clicks to get to an item&#8217;s Twitter page, and most of those pages ask people to visit a third-party website to actually buy anything.</p> <p>All told, this feature seems like little more than a half-baked experiment that Twitter wanted to release to show that it cares about commerce. It has potential, but it&#8217;s not that easy to use, and its lead &#8220;curators&#8221; are just good self-promoters.</p> <div id="author-info"> <h3>Nathaniel Mott</h3> <div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;"> <img width="100" height="100" src="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/nathan.jpg?w=100&#038;h=100" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="nathaniel" /> </div> Nathaniel Mott is a staff writer for PandoDaily, covering startups and technology from New York. </div><!-- #author-info --><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170321&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4776902f/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231123334995/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4776902f/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/22/twitter-ramps-up-commerce-efforts-with-new-collections/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Nathaniel Mott</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/twitter-cash.jpg?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/twitter-cash.jpg?w=100"><media:title type="html">twitter-cash</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/728b94b5fd5bcafaaf85deacd6159edb?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">nathanielmott</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/twitter-cash.jpg"><media:title type="html">twitter-cash</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Uber stops people from carrying guns on vehicles it doesn’t own driven by people it doesn’t employ</title><link>http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4775f64e/sc/7/l/0Lpando0N0C20A150C0A60C220Cuber0Estops0Epeople0Efrom0Ecarrying0Eguns0Eon0Evehicles0Eit0Edoesnt0Eown0Edriven0Eby0Epeople0Eit0Edoesnt0Eemploy0C/story01.htm</link><description>Uber has &lt;a href="http://uberpeople.net/threads/uber-firearms-prohibition-policy.23437/" target="_blank"&gt;changed its legal policy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/firearms-prohibition-policy" target="_blank"&gt;stop drivers and passengers&lt;/a&gt; from bringing firearms onto any &amp;#8220;ride arranged through the Uber platform.&amp;#8221; The New Republic &lt;a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122094/uber-isnt-letting-its-drivers-carry-guns-anymore" target="_blank"&gt;draws a connection&lt;/a&gt; between Uber&amp;#8217;s new policy and an incident earlier this year which saw an driver in Chicago fire his gun &amp;#8212; for which he had a concealed carry permit &amp;#8212; at someone else shooting into a crowd.

Uber is infamous for its drivers&#8217; bad behavior, and despite what many people might think, I don&#8217;t see much reason for most people to carry guns around.</p> <p>But there&#8217;s still something funny about Uber making a rule that stops people from carrying firearms onto vehicles it doesn&#8217;t own that are driven by people <a href="http://pando.com/2015/05/27/florida-man-undermines-ubers-claim-that-drivers-arent-employees/">who are considered</a> &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; instead of actual employees.</p> <p>Uber has been careful to portray the change as something it&#8217;s doing in conjunction with its driver &#8220;partners,&#8221; however. As a company spokesperson told the New Republic in an emailed statement:</p> <blockquote><p>We have adopted a no-firearms policy to ensure that both riders and drivers feel safe and comfortable on the platform.

When the VC contingent (made up of Spark&#8217;s Bijan Sabet, Vegas Tech Fund&#8217;s Zach Ware, Jumpstart Foundry&#8217;s Vic Gatto, Exhilarator&#8217;s Michael Goldstein, TechSquare Labs&#8217; Dr. Paul Judge, and BIP Capital&#8217;s James Hamilton) pushed back, August Ventures partner and part-time Harvard Business School lecturer David Hornik jumped onto the stage to stand in as Umano&#8217;s council.</p> <p>And that&#8217;s were things really got fun.</p> <p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to build immense value with the $100K that you are going to give them, so what are the terms that you think are rational for them where you are going to get a return and they are going to build a big business, so then they have something to go off of,&#8221; Hornik said to the panel.</p> <p>The sticking point of the whole negotiation rested on whether or not the convertible note, which converts to equity at the next priced equity round, would have a valuation cap, the valuation amount at which the note converts. Umano wanted to have it cap-less, and the VC panel wanted the note to have a $5 million cap.</p> <p>If you&#8217;ve been following the venture capital blogosphere for the past month, you&#8217;d know that there has been a pretty loud call coming from some of the VC blogs about what and what doesn&#8217;t make sense for entrepreneurs when negotiating the terms of a convertible note. One of the key issues that <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2015/05/30/one-simple-paragraph-every-entrepreneur-should-add-to-their-convertible-notes/">Upstart Ventures&#8217; Mark Suster</a> broke down had to do with liquidation preferences, advising founders to include a note that their investment will convert to equity at a 1X liquidation preference. Brad Feld followed up Suster&#8217;s post to break this down even more, discussion how returns and be affected, and can screw the entrepreneur, whether or not the convertible notes converts at a pre- or post-money valuation.</p> <p>As Feld said in his blog, &#8220;I think we are just starting to see the complexity, side effects, and unintended consequences created by the massive proliferation of convertible notes over the past few years.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I’m pretty mellow about them as I’ve accepted that they are part of the funding landscape, in contrast to a number of angels and VCs who feel strongly one way or the other,&#8221; Feld added.</p> <p>At Pandoland, the Umano ask created a unique situation that showed just how nuanced and potentially confusing a problem note negotiation can be On one side, you had a group of VCs acting as angels and on the other, a VC, acting as a founder&#8217;s advisor. Almost everyone involved was in some way acting against their usual interests. As Bijan Sabet said, &#8220;99 percent of the time, I do equity.&#8221;</p> <p>Vic Gatto started the discussion down the wormhole when he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable with a an uncapped note, and I&#8217;m not going to do an uncapped note.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;My view is that the cap will help you grow the company and build more value. I should get get some benefit from that, putting in money today,&#8221; he added.</p> <p>When asked what he thought would be a fair cap, Gatto responded, &#8220;I just want to establish that its not fair to have no cap at all.&#8221;</p> <p>Hornik was quick to respond. &#8220;To put it in terms of fairness, It&#8217;s not a fairness question,&#8221; Hornik said. &#8220;Some of the greatest companies we&#8217;ve ever seen have had uncapped note. There&#8217;s been perfectly fair outcomes in that context.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;ll agree to, that&#8217;s a different story,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s not unfair. It&#8217;s perfectly fair.&#8221;</p> <p>After conferring multiple times, as moderator Paul Carr said at one point, like a congressional hearing, the the VCs gave a counteroffer.</p> <p>But then things took another turn. &#8220;Bijan knows my rant on capped notes,&#8221; said Hornik later in the negotiation. &#8220;The reality is that the capped note is a tails you win, heads I lose situation.&#8221;</p> <p>So, seemingly through Hornik&#8217;s advice, Umano asked to do a priced round with a $4.5 million valuation. This led Sabet to respond that he thought that it wasn&#8217;t a bad idea, but thought it had a major downside because, as compared to the convertible note process, a priced round of funding includes a long, often expensive legal process — the reason that most angels and early stage company&#8217;s do convertible notes. &#8220;It&#8217;s just exhausting,&#8221; Sabet said. And he had a point, for the amount of money being invested, a longer priced round process kind of defeats the purpose and usefulness of the entire prize.</p> <p>To Sabet&#8217;s &#8220;exhaustive&#8221; remark, Hornik — a venture capitalist mind you — said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a legitimate claim. I used to be an attorney, and I think that argument that it&#8217;s a bunch of legal work is just bullshit.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve been ripping us off for year&#8217;s then David,&#8221; Sabet responded jokingly referring to the legal costs involved in the process.</p> <p>&#8220;This is an argument to justify VCs winning at any instance,&#8221; Hornik added.</p> <p>&#8220;This is incredible, it&#8217;s like VC on VC violence, or Celebrity Death Match,&#8221; Carr interjected.</p> <p>However, eventually, Hornik and the Torrey brothers agreed that the whole debate had gone above their comfort level.

The mascot currently adorns the 13 storefronts operated by RelaxFeet, a local, affordable chain of massage parlors.</p> <p>&#8220;From the outside, you know, people want to know if this is a legit massage place or not. I think we still have a way to go, but we are trying to build our brand image, that&#8217;s why we developed the logo and the mascot,&#8221; says Vincent Tom, one of RelaxFeet&#8217;s co-founders.</p> <p>RelaxFeet offers a hot foot soak and fully-clothed, full-body massage, for the low, low price of $25 an hour. It&#8217;s a clean but no-frills experience. The foot-bath, steeped with a variety of herbal blends, happens in a plastic bag set inside a plastic tub. Plain white towels cover rows of easy-chairs – spoiler alert: they fold down into massage tables with face-holes – in a mostly open room. The implements used are all affordable but effective.</p> <p>All of the company&#8217;s 60 masseuses are California certified massage therapists. They come almost exclusively from China, and for many this is their first job in the US.</p> <p>&#8220;There is this stereotype when people think of Asian massage places, they think of the sex industry and of things like human trafficking. But our employees have to have a green card and a license. They are all insured. There is a guy for the Health Department that comes and checks every week, we have inspections all the time,&#8221; says Tom.</p> <p>&#8220;A lot of our employees, people sometimes complain that they don’t really speak English. But a lot of these men and women came to the US for a better life, and they can’t do anything else. Many of them have acupuncture or massage licenses from China and they had to go through school all over again here because those certificates aren&#8217;t valid.&#8221;</p> <p>The business began in 2007 with a single store in the Sunset District. Tom, an SF native and graduate of the University of San Francisco, returned from years spent in the restaurant business in China to form the company with Lee Haobin and a silent investor.</p> <p>&#8220;It was kind of a surprise that it did so well,&#8221; he says.</p> <p>It was during the economic downturn that the business really took off. At the time, commercial rents and real estate prices were such that RelaxFeet, despite its small margins, was able to gobble up leases and even purchase some of its locations, several of which are in neighborhoods that have since become trendy. And despite the wild increases in rents, the company has continued to expand: they opened two new stores in 2014.</p> <p>Though the basic customer experience hasn&#8217;t changed much over the years, Tom says they have been tweaking things to be more efficient. Nowadays, the towels are washed and sanitized by Aramark, instead of in-house. They&#8217;ve hired someone to update their website to allow online bookings and other offerings – &#8220;it&#8217;s nothing major like Google or anything&#8221; – and invested in better POS and accounting software. Based on customer feedback, they&#8217;ve added private rooms to some locations. They used the site 99designs to solicit mascot designs.</p> <p>It&#8217;s somewhat fascinating that a massage business catering to middle-income earners should flourish in this city, even while it becomes an increasingly difficult place for the middle class to live. Especially given that RelaxFeet does no marketing. Tom says that the key has been changing the perception of massage.</p> <p>&#8220;It used to be a luxury thing. Not everyone could afford it, and even those that could couldn&#8217;t do it on a regular basis&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Our core business has always been: to make massage affordable and accessible. Our target audience is the people who really need massage: taxi drivers, retail workers, people who work with their hands or are on their feet all day. We haven&#8217;t really done much marketing, it&#8217;s all been word-of-mouth, reputation-based.&#8221;</p> <p>Indeed, this is how I heard about the place back in 2008. Full disclosure: I&#8217;ve been a RelaxFeet customer since.</p> <p>Tom says that looking forward, the business will have to continue to improve its services and integrate technology, in part to meet the challenge of the recent minimum wage increase. It will continue to tweak the offering slightly. They are beginning to offer outcall massage – &#8220;kind of like Uber or something like that&#8221; – and have developed some new membership plans.</p> <p>It&#8217;s an unlikely story of the success of a disruptive enterprise, in these heady days when so many such stories fight for traction. It&#8217;s a story of immigration, a story of gender – Tom says 70% of RelaxFeet customers are women – and a story of innovation. But its a story about a small business, so its a story that is never told.</p> <p>…</p> <p><em><strong>SPONSORED</strong>: Partnering with Intuit Developer will help expose your apps to millions of small businesses with an appetite for innovation. <a class="external" href="https://appcenter.intuit.com/promos/devopportunity?cid=ipp_devx_HP_devoppapr2015_Pando" target="_blank">Add yours</a> to the list.</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170223&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231123251153/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4768c3ec/sc/38/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/19/the-permanent-startup-relaxfeet-disrupts-the-massage-industry-one-foot-at-a-time/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Dan Raile</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-19-at-7-35-43-pm.png?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-19-at-7-35-43-pm.png?w=100"><media:title type="html">Screen Shot 2015-06-19 at 7.35.43 PM</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dfe828a6e9aa52348c9b6da82553c8eb?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">danraile</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-19-at-7-35-43-pm.png"><media:title type="html">Screen Shot 2015-06-19 at 7.35.43 PM</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Google, Apple, Genentech file to be included in suit they fought to be removed from.

This program ends January 31, 2016, at which point a permanent arrangement will be considered, utilizing data gathered over the 18-month pilot.</p> <p>All the while, the giant shuttles rattle the windows of city sleepers without fail, each weekday morning and evening.</p> <p>(A little known fact: every morning, tech workers of San Francisco line up awaiting transport to various sexy office parks. But they never suspect that as soon as the last bus leaves, a call goes out from an appointed window: &#8220;They&#8217;re Gone!&#8221; This message is relayed block-to-block by way of an ingenious system resembling the smoke signal networks familiar to fans of Westerns. Once the calling tree circuit is completed, the city&#8217;s emergency warning speakers blast &#8220;Lights&#8221; by Journey and most remaining residents take to the sidewalks to dance and catch up with their neighbors. This is not done out of spite for tech workers, but simply because it is good for public health to stand up and shake one&#8217;s limbs in the morning, as various Communist governments have realized through observance of similar daily tai chi rituals. I&#8217;m sorry if you&#8217;ve missed this.)</p> <p>And as the buses have rumbled along, so to has a case filed in San Francisco Superior Court soon after the pilot took effect. The action has made halting progress since the Coalition for Fair, Legal and Environmental Transit and the SEIU 1021 brought their complaint back in May 2014.</p> <p>The plaintiffs are wielding that quintessential Californian cudgel, the California Environmental Quality Act, seeking to throw an Environmental Impact Report into the works of the pilot shuttle program. They also allege that the shuttles are illegal under state vehicle code, stopping as they do in red zones.</p> <p>The list of defendants in the case has been winnowed down consistently from the start. The original petition named all the involved corporations and the shuttle companies with which they contract. By the end of May, only public entities – The City, the Board of Supervisors, the Planning Department, SFMTA, and the Mayor – remained as defendants. Apple, Genentech and Google, along with the shuttle companies, successfully argued that they should be removed from the case entirely. They were.</p> <p>Which is what makes it surprising that yesterday Apple, Google and Genentech filed a motion to be included in the case again, this time as &#8216;Intervenors&#8217;. In doing so they took up the very arguments for inclusion that the opposing side presented unsuccessfully last month. Which is unusual, to say the least. The rest of the excused private companies remained silent but those three, which are each represented by the same firm, Morrison Foerster. It bears noting that that firm&#8217;s website can be found at <a href="http://www.mofo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mofo.com</a>.</p> <p>&#8220;They’ve been begging us from the time we brought this lawsuit to let them out, and in open court said we had only included them to attract publicity,&#8221; said Richard Drury, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs.</p> <p>Generally, intervenors carry the same rights and liabilities of other interested parties. They could be deposed and subjected to discovery proceedings. Perhaps, as involved but non-sued parties, they can seek to limit their exposure in some material way.</p> <p>Another explanation, more likely spared the wrath of Occam&#8217;s blade, is that this new tack could draw things out, and a delay probably favors the defendants, since the pilot program is reaching its end and pilots tend to run directly into permanent policies. Indeed, the defendants filed yesterday to postpone the trial date – currently scheduled for June 29 – until October. In their motion to postpone they argue for the initiation of a discovery process, which will take some time if allowed. Generally in a trial of this sort, no discovery takes place. The case is based entirely on the administrative record – the documents that were before the Board of Supes at the time they voted in the program, and the transcripts of those hearings.</p> <p>If the various City agencies intend to draw the case out in hopes it will simply go away, Drury has bad news for them.</p> <p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be moot even if the trial were extended past January 31st. The City wants to do a permanent program, and that could still require and EIR and still be found illegal. Otherwise, they could theoretically continue to do pilot programs forever without us ever able to get it to trial in 18 months. But there is a mootness exemption called &#8220;capable of repetition but evading review&#8221; which keeps that from happening.&#8221;</p> <p>Summer by the bay promises to feature plenty of action in the courts with tech companies as defendants, and there&#8217;s now a chance again that the &#8220;Google Bus&#8221; issue could be part of that fray.

Not that the broader sphere of cultural criticism was in some dire need of another blogger&#8217;s recap of a television show. But the season&#8217;s tenth and final episode, &#8220;Two Days of the Condor,&#8221; holds special significance for Pando, as the fate of the show&#8217;s protagonist became tied up with a subplot that echoes one of this site&#8217;s most-read and most-important stories.</p> <p>In January of 2014, <a href="http://pando.com/2014/01/23/the-techtopus-how-silicon-valleys-most-celebrated-ceos-conspired-to-drive-down-100000-tech-engineers-wages/">Mark Ames published on Pando</a> evidence of a conspiracy &#8212; nicknamed by Ames the &#8220;Techtopus&#8221; &#8212; between Apple, Google, and other tech mega-firms to drive down the wages of a hundred thousand employees through a variety of unspoken and explicit anti-competitive gambits. The scandal has since expanded to include more and more tech firms along with a number of Hollywood animation studios, and the outcome of the case &#8212; despite the criminal nature of the violations &#8212; is now headed toward a final settlement payout to workers in the amount of $415 million, <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27626712/silicon-valley-no-poaching-deal-appears-headed-approval" target="_blank">which is slated for approval next month</a>. But perhaps the biggest legacy of this scandal is the way it represents a corruption of Silicon Valley&#8217;s initial core values &#8212; values which were supposed to put workers ahead of their scheming corporate overlords.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s significant that the IP lawsuit between Hooli and Pied Piper at the heart of <em>Silicon Valley</em>&#8216;s second season was ultimately decided thanks to illegal non-competes found in Hooli&#8217;s worker contracts, which nullified the tech giant&#8217;s employment agreements and thus invalidated its claims over the work Richard did as one of its coders. Granted, Hooli&#8217;s illegal and onerous non-compete agreements are much different than the handshake agreements not to hire each other&#8217;s employees that the Techtopus scandal concerned. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s telling that the writers of <em>Silicon Valley, </em>in their quest to encapsulate the zeitgeist of the modern tech economy, chose to include a subplot that echoed the same anti-worker behavior of the industry&#8217;s largest players.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the episode captured a feeling that its writers have attempted &#8212; and more often than not failed &#8212; to portray again and again: the scrappy joy of building a company. <a href="http://pando.com/2015/06/08/these-arent-real-journalists-richard-theyre-tech-journalists-last-nights-silicon-valley-reviewed/">After Richard confessed in court last week</a> to using Hooli resources to conduct a minor test on Pied Piper&#8217;s technology, the team is all but certain that it will lose the IP lawsuit and be forced to give up its product to Gavin Belson&#8217;s monstrous and well-lawyered tech firm. That&#8217;s when they notice a curious development on the live condor feed they&#8217;re running, which up until this point has been fully bereft of drama. A worker has become trapped in a crevasse near the eggs and is now caught on camera pleading for help and hanging onto life by its threads in a dramatic display reminiscent of the film <em>127 Hours</em>. The feed has now attracted hundreds of thousands of concurrent viewers and, despite the dire circumstances, even inspired a series of Internet memes.</p> <p>And so rather than delete Pied Piper&#8217;s underlying code to keep it out of the reach of Hooli&#8217;s tentacles, Dinesh, Gilfoyle, Jared, and even the until-now useless Erlich have banded together to keep the stream running until the worker is saved. That means busting down the walls of the incubator house to create more server space, allowing sections of the living room to erupt in flames as the heat of the hardware becomes too much for it to handle, and even inviting Erlich to battle through his &#8220;carpal tunnel&#8221; to write some code &#8212; a task which it turns out he&#8217;s better at than any of the rockstar founder power plays he&#8217;s been attempting over the past two seasons. With all-but-certain death in sight and no apparent financial reward for their toil, it&#8217;s an exhilarating example of a team of misfits coming together to accomplish something for no reason other than a desire to see through the thing they spent so much time building and defending.</p> <p>The victory, however, is shortlived. Raviga, the VC firm run by Laurie Bream, decides to buy Russ Hanneman&#8217;s board seats &#8212; by the way, I hope this isn&#8217;t the last we see of Russ, the most hilarious character the show&#8217;s ever conjured &#8212; giving her a controlling stake in Pied Piper. And while she&#8217;s enamored with the startup&#8217;s &#8220;underlying technology,&#8221; she is less excited about the various missteps Richard has taken throughout the life of the company, which had brought it to the brink of collapse again and again. And so in the blink of an eye, after turning down millions of dollars and fighting tooth-and-nail to maintain control of his company, Richard is ousted as CEO.</p> <p>Of course, Richard&#8217;s &#8220;missteps&#8221; were often less the result of incompetence and more due to the founder&#8217;s moral compass &#8212; which, if <em>Silicon Valley </em>along with the real-life industry it&#8217;s based on are any indication, is a decided disadvantage. And by ending the season on such a brutally yet realistically cynical note, immediately after putting forth such a joyous vision of startup life, the show has finally balanced the two competing themes of the tech industry in 2015. Sure, the show has explored both the idealism and cutthroat behavior of Silicon Valley in the past, but usually it did so in a way that contradicted itself, making for a weak brew of half-hearted satire.</p> <p>In the finale, however the writers effectively explored the tension between celebrating and condemning the Valley, and did so more powerfully and clearly than most other pieces of tech industry commentary, fictional or otherwise. Yes, the Valley allows for world-changing companies to be built out of garages, and yes it allows for long-standing, restrictive, and corrupt business institutions to be disrupted. But the industry is still ultimately at the mercy of giant firms capable of unimaginable ruthlessness in the pursuit of profits.</p> <p>To quote Batman&#8217;s Harvey Dent, &#8220;You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.&#8221; And for now, at least, it looks as if Richard is headed toward a hero&#8217;s demise.</p> <p><em>[illustration by Brad Jonas]</em></p> <div id="author-info"> <h3>David Holmes</h3> <div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;"> <img width="86" height="100" src="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/studio20profile.jpg?w=86&#038;h=100" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Studio20profile" /> </div> <div>David Holmes is Pando's East Coast Editor.

Omidyar was specifically named in the September 7, 2011 subpoena, which strongly suggested an ongoing <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_18975552">FBI and US attorneys office investigation</a> into the First Look Media publisher’s role in “stealing Craigslist’s secret sauce,” as a Delaware judge <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/27/business/la-fi-ebay-20110927">described</a> it.</p> <p>As we <a href="http://pando.com/2014/12/01/whitman-omidyar-craigslist-ebay/">reported</a> last year, eBay aggressively pushed to get control of the 28 percent stake in Craigslist held by one of the company’s three partners, who put it up for sale in 2004. Craigslist balked, fearing that eBay would destroy its altruistic, anti-capitalist, community-based culture. When the deal fell through, eBay Chairman and primary shareholder Pierre Omidyar was brought into the negotiations to convince Craigslist that his only interest was in maintaining Craigslist’s values and that community-based culture. Omidyar and other eBay executives withheld from Craigslist one vital piece of information: eBay was already working on launching its own online classifieds operation, Kijiji, which in private memos eBay executives nicknamed “Craigslist Killer.”</p> <p>Omidyar convinced the two remaining Craigslist founders—Craig Newmark and Jim Buckmaster—that his intentions were as pure as theirs were; in return, not only did they accept eBay’s offer, they also insisted that Omidyar sit on Craigslist’s board of directors—a position Omidyar used to pass on more of Craigslist’s proprietary “secret sauce” to eBay’s “Craigslist Killer” project.</p> <p>Craigslist’s founders were caught completely unawares by Omidyar’s duplicity. As Buckmaster wrote in an email to Meg Whitman back in 2004:</p> <blockquote><p>“i should also mention that craig has immense respect for pierre, and it would mean a lot to him personally to have such a giant and pioneer of online community working with us at craigslist in this capacity.”</p></blockquote> <p>The Pierre Omidyar revealed in emails, memos and filings is very different—far more cunning and calculating—than the goofy billionaire waif <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/pierre-omidyar-first-look-media.html">portrayed</a> in snotty East Coast magazines. Perhaps the goofy billioinaire Omidyar is more comforting for journalists and readers alike; but actually believing in the Omidyar-waif can be dangerous, as Craigslist’s owners discovered:</p> <blockquote><p>“After the meeting, Omidyar reported back to [eBay executive Garrett] Price that he did not think he raised any ‘red flags’ in Newmark’s mind. As a result of Omidyar’s assurances, Newmark trusted that eBay shared the same community values as craigslist.”</p></blockquote> <p>In the Delaware judge’s ruling in one of the two main lawsuits &#8212; which stated that Craigslist was right in stripping eBay of its board seat, but wrong in unilaterally diluting eBay’s shares &#8212; he confirmed many of Craigslist’s core grievances against eBay and Omidyar:</p> <blockquote><p>“eBay executives calculated that the eBay-craigslist relationship would at least provide them with an opportunity to learn the ‘secret sauce’ of craigslist’s success, presumably so that eBay could spread that sauce all over its own competing classifieds site.”</p></blockquote> <p>When Craigslist’s owners finally discovered a few years later that they’d been used and deceived by Omidyar and other eBay executives to help them launch their own “Craigslist Killer” project, they initially tried to discuss their concerns privately and discreetly—and got rudely shut down.</p> <p>Garrett Price, an eBay executive whom Omidyar named as his replacement on Craigslist’s board of directors, responded to Buckmaster’s emails about their relationship by telling Buckmaster</p> <blockquote><p>“that he and Newmark were mortal, but eBay was not, and eBay would acquire 100 percent of craigslist whether it took decades and, if necessary, over Newmark’s and Buckmaster’s dead bodies.”</p></blockquote> <p>Buckmaster responded by reminding Price of their agreements, particularly their agreement to have a three-year “courtship period” to see if their two company cultures properly meshed.</p> <p>Price responded to Buckmaster:</p> <blockquote><p>“that was then, this is now.&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>He also threatened to unleash Meg Whitman the predator on Craigslist’s doe-like owners, warning that there were two Meg Whitmans:</p> <blockquote><p>“the good Meg [and] the evil Meg [who] could be a monster when she got angry and frustrated.”</p></blockquote> <p>The reality is that the two corporate cultures were as antithetical as any imaginable in Silicon Valley. Behind their backs, Craigslist’s anti-greed, community-oriented values were a source of much laughter and derision in private eBay executive emails that <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dd2df1ce-ebf9-11de-8070-00144feab49a.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3KYDRTFMz">mocked</a> Craigslist for holding “amateurish board meetings,” describing its owners as “definitely from another planet.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, eBay continued using its board seat and stake in Craigslist to “steal its secret sauce.” In an email containing proprietary Craigslist budget figures, written by eBay’s in-house counsel Brian Levey to other executives, he boasted:</p> <blockquote><p>“Here are the numbers for [c]raigslist’s 2007 financial plan. Look at all that cash! Please pass along to whomever on a need-to-know basis. Thx!”</p></blockquote> <p>In 2009, a Delaware judge asked eBay’s counsel, Levey, to confirm he’d really done that:</p> <blockquote><p>“Q. You took confidential craigslist information and you gave it to the people at eBay that were planning to launch Kijiji in the United States in the spring of 2007, didn’t you?</p> <p>“Levey: Yes.”</p></blockquote> <p>Finally, in 2007, Craigslist’s Buckmaster wrote to eBay’s Meg Whitman asking to formally terminate their agreement and return their shares. When Whitman didn’t respond, Craigslist’s attorney contacted eBay’s Brian Levey and asked him how Whitman reacted to Buckmaster’s email. Levey responded,</p> <blockquote><p>“How would Jim [Buckmaster] and Craig [Newmark] react if Whitman told them to go ‘pound sand’?”</p></blockquote> <p>Whitman and eBay achieved peak <a href="http://pando.com/2014/03/25/newly-unsealed-documents-show-steve-jobs-brutally-callous-response-after-getting-a-google-employee-fired/">Steve Jobs asshole-ery</a> in a series of email exchanges after reading a Fortune magazine article in which Craigslist’s Buckmaster still somehow managed to maintain a positive attitude towards his eBay shareholders, telling the interviewer that while he was concerned about eBay’s new online classifieds business, “our first instinct is still to trust eBay.”</p> <p>Whitman quoted that in an email she sent around to other eBay executives, saying she found Buckmaster’s optimism “pretty funny.”</p> <p>eBay’s Garrett Price—Omidyar’s choice to replace him on Craigslist’s board—emailed Whitman back:</p> <blockquote><p>“[y]es, I am glad to read that he trusts us.&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>To which Whitman responded with a Jobs-ian smiley:</p> <blockquote><p>“Love this. :)”</p></blockquote> <p>Now that the two companies have finally settled and moved on, and the federal criminal investigation into Omidyar and other executives appears to have been put to rest, the real question hanging over this is the role that the Intercept’s publisher played in stealing “the secret sauce” from idealists who trusted him. Omidyar was investigated in 2010 and 2011 and perhaps beyond that; we don’t know. Like the Ferguson policeman who shot to death Michael Brown, Pierre Omidyar is one of those rare lucky few Americans investigated by a grand jury, but never charged or indicted.</p> <p>Two years after being criminally investigated for stealing secrets and misrepresentation, Omidyar ingratiated himself with a pair of journalists, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, who were the only two people given the complete cache of Snowden secrets. When initially asked about Omidyar’s trustworthiness, back in 2013, <a href="http://www.scrible.com/contentview/page/AKQG1111H4H2P2J300S5S28BCI800KA2:103606998/index.html?utm_source=tb_permalink&#38;utm_medium=permalink&#38;utm_campaign=tb_buttons&#38;_sti=1818202">Greenwald told Amy Goodman</a> that he believed Omidyar,</p> <blockquote><p>“would not start a new business in order to make money.

Yet further information as to the scope and specifics of that appeal has neither been filed with the court or discussed in public.</p> <p>Weeks earlier, the venerable VC firm had offered to drop its motion to recover nearly $1 million in court costs should Pao waive her right to appeal. After months of deflecting the appeal question, Pao scuttled any such offer by quietly filing notice of appeal on June 1.</p> <p>Yesterday, after a brief hearing in San Francisco Superior Court, Judge Harold Kahn <a href="http://query.sftc.org/Minds_asp_pdf/Viewer/DownLoadDocument.asp?PGCNT=0">settled</a> the issue of those outstanding costs.</p> <blockquote><p>&#8220;There is no doubt that KPCB has &#8220;vastly&#8221; greater economic resources than Ms. Pao. Nor is there any doubt that Ms. Pao is not indigent&#8230;it is also undoubtedly true that the $864,680.25 that KPCB seeks in expert fees is a material amount in the context of Ms. Pao&#8217;s resources. On the other hand, this amount is not a material amount in the context of KPCB&#8217;s resources.&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Kahn ruled that Pao is responsible to pay $275,966.63 to cover Kleiner&#8217;s expert witness deposition, testimony and travel costs. The reduced amount is based on Kahn&#8217;s &#8220;rough cut&#8221; calculations scaling the reward to reflect the disparity between the two parties&#8217; financial resources.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the plaintiff&#8217;s camp has remained tight-lipped as to the details of the appeal. Now that the fee issue is out of the way, the path seems cleared for the appeal process to begin in earnest.</p> <p>&#160;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170190&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4766f400/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231064585959/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/4766f400/sc/7/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/19/pao-to-pay-kpcb-275k-in-fees-way-cleared-for-appeal/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Dan Raile</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/epaolowres.jpg?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/epaolowres.jpg?w=100"><media:title type="html">EPaoLowRes</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dfe828a6e9aa52348c9b6da82553c8eb?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">danraile</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/epaolowres.jpg"><media:title type="html">EPaoLowRes</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Pandoland’s digital swear jar: The results are in!</title><link>http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4766ec8f/sc/15/l/0Lpando0N0C20A150C0A60C190Cpandolands0Edigital0Eswear0Ejar0Ethe0Eresults0Eare0Ein0C/story01.htm</link><description>Let&amp;#8217;s face it: The Pando team&amp;#8211; and many of our guests&amp;#8211; just aren&amp;#8217;t going to stop swearing on stage.

So at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pandoland2015.com">Pandoland</a>, which just wrapped up in Nashville, we decided to monetize all that profanity with a <a href="http://www.pandoland.wtf">digital swear jar</a> and leaderboard. The cost was $10 a swear, with all proceeds going to St. Jude&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Research Hospital.</p> <p>St Jude&#8217;s is a cause very dear to my heart. Not only did I grow up in Memphis and got to see first hand a lot of amazing work St. Jude does, but as anyone who has been around me for five minutes knows, my children are the absolute light of my life. I can&#8217;t imagine the horror of anything happening to them. No child is <a href="https://www.stjude.org/about-st-jude/unique-operating-model.html">ever refused</a> treatment at St. Jude. More impressive: Families never receive a bill from the hospital for travel, treatment, housing, or food. It costs $2 million a day to run St. Jude, and I wish we&#8217;d sworn enough to make a meaningful dent in that number. Next year we need to invite Ben Horowitz.</p> <p>The digital swear jar was built and maintained by David Repas an awesome local Nashville entrepreneur we met at our pre-Southland Hackathon last year, who generously offering his time and talents to build the swear jar and even track the individual swears. (Ironically, David almost never swears.)</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the final tally&#8230; (In my defense, I was on stage for pretty much the whole event.)</p> <p>Sarah Lacy:  $370<br /> David Hornik: $70<br /> Bradford Shellhammer: $60<br /> Paul Carr: $40<br /> Mike Herring: $20<br /> Bijan Sabet: $20<br /> David Holmes: $10<br /> Alex Haro: $10<br /> Andy Sparks: $10<br /> Jose Antonio Vargas: $10<br /> Katia Beauchamp: $10<br /> Michael Sippey: $10</p> <p>Particularly impressive was August Capital&#8217;s David Hornik who wasn&#8217;t even planning on  being on stage, much less swearing on stage. He bought a ticket and traveled to Nashville originally just to attend Pandoland. I drafted him at the last minute into leading a salon conversation called, &#8220;Have Silicon Valley VCs lost their minds?&#8221; that got him a few of those swear points. But it was when he unexpectedly stormed the stage during the startup competition&#8217;s term sheet negotiation to advocate on behalf of the winning company Umano that he really upped his total. (And also created one of the most memorable moments of the entire event. I spent half of Wednesday night trying to convince people we didn&#8217;t set it up.)</p> <p>So here&#8217;s what happens next: The Pando Staff is going to round our total of $420 up to an even $1,000 and donate to St. Jude by clicking on the <a href="https://shop.stjude.org/GiftCatalog/donation.do?cID=14262&#38;pID=24671&#38;sc_icid=givemm-btn-donate-now">BIG RED DONATE button on this page</a>. It couldn&#8217;t be easier. We are trusting our other attendees to do the same&#8230;. and encouraging them to also round their swears up to $1,000. We&#8217;ll update this article when we know how many each donated. (And, of course, if you&#8217;d like to make a donation yourself, you absolutely should. We&#8217;ll note that here too.)</p> <p>Thanks again for all the speakers, judges and mentors who helped make Pandoland an absolutely one-of-a-kind event &#8212; and of course to everyone who joined us in Nashville.

He was in San Francisco with MIT researcher and database pioneer Michael Stonebraker, Ph.D., who was in the Bay Area to accept the 2014 Association for Computing Machinery&#8217;s A.M. Turing Award, known by some as the &#8220;Nobel Prize of Comupting.&#8221;</p> <p>Both Palmer and Stonebraker have a long track record in the big data computing space. The two partnered to build Vertica — which was acquired by Hewlett Packard in 2011 — among other projects. First at the University of California, Berkeley, then at MIT, Stonebraker worked to develop many innovations and helped found many data related startups. He is being recognized by the ACM for, as the announcement for the award stated, &#8220;invent[ing] many of the concepts that are used in almost all modern database systems.&#8221;</p> <p>Tamr’s big data business intelligence solutions to more easily connect and integrate large swaths of business information that is collected from various enterprise applications and software. Specifically, the company&#8217;s &#8220;data-unification platform&#8221; combines machine learning algorithms with human insight to make useful and to better understand how the all the data collected in a businesses various computing systems is related.</p> <p>In a statement, Stonebraker said, “Tamr’s technology and approach to scalable data unification will be the next big thing in data and analytics &#8211; similar to how column-store databases were the next big thing in 2004.”</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been just over a year since we launched the company officially,&#8221; said Palmer. &#8220;And it&#8217;s night and day considered to a year ago. The fundamentals of the business are remarkable and we are adding new large customers every day.&#8221;</p> <p>Among the Fortune 1000 companies that are using Tamr&#8217;s big data and business intelligence platform are GE, Novartis, Roche, and others. &#8220;They all have a lot of data variety,&#8221; said Palmer. &#8220;As more and more of them have learned about us and we have talked to them about their problems, we have found tremendous new applications for Tamr.&#8221;</p> <p>Some of the company&#8217;s existing customers liked the product so much, they led the companies latest fundraise.</p> <p>Participants in the $25.2 million funding round include Hewlett Packard Ventures, Thomson Reuters, MassMutual Ventures, SineWave Ventures, and Work-Bench Ventures, as well as previous investors NEA and Google Ventures. To date, Tamr has raised $42.2 million in funding.</p> <p>&#8220;Thomson Reuters, HP, and MassMutual have been so excited about what we are doing that they&#8217;ve been asking for a long time if they could participate in the company more broadly,&#8221; said Palmer. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity for us to bring in some extra money, and to take our relationships with those companies to the next level.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170177&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/47654982/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231049731920/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47654982/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/19/tamr-gets-25-1-million-in-new-funding-as-its-cto-wins-turing-award/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Dennis Keohane</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-19-at-7-48-51-am.png?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-19-at-7-48-51-am.png?w=100"><media:title type="html">Screen Shot 2015-06-19 at 7.48.51 AM</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/85b6094b53e244a395c8b5488021dc66?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">denbkeohane</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-19-at-7-48-51-am.png"><media:title type="html">Screen Shot 2015-06-19 at 7.48.51 AM</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Is Alibaba investing its way into a muddle?</title><link>http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/4760b23d/sc/21/l/0Lpando0N0C20A150C0A60C180Cis0Ealibaba0Einvesting0Eits0Eway0Einto0Ea0Emuddle0C/story01.htm</link><description>What exactly is Alibaba becoming?

The company&#8217;s unique business model, meteoric rise and dominance of China&#8217;s e-commerce (not to mention its <a href="http://pando.com/2014/09/19/alibaba-a-tasty-dish-just-dont-ask-how-its-made/">opaque structure</a>) have always belied easy analogies like “the Amazon of China.” Amazon disrupted a traditional commercial infrastructure with its site. Alibaba built a commercial infrastructure where one had <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/15/investing/alibaba-amazon-china/">never really existed</a>.</p> <p>If the business model that gave Alibaba a $215 billion market cap has been tricky for some to get their minds around, whatever strategy Alibaba is pursuing for its next phase of growth is even harder to understand. Alibaba has always relied on a complex network of corporate partners and minority investments. Now this network is growing so vast it&#8217;s getting hard to discern any overall strategy, except maybe growth itself.</p> <p>Beyond its core marketplaces, Alibaba went public last year with a payment service (Alipay), a browser and search product (UC Web), as well as location-based services, financing, marketing and logistics. It also had minority investments in companies like video app Youku Tudou and social media app Weibo. All played some role in the Alibaba ecosystem, supporting its marketplaces and their participants.</p> <p>In the past year or so, Alibaba been busy with a number of other investments inside China and beyond. Many of them add incrementally to the central idea of creating the platform where purveyors of goods or content can connect with consumers who are looking for them.</p> <p>Last year, Alibaba invested in a $250 million round raised by Lyft, and this year it invested in Didi and Kuaidi, two car-hailing apps serving China. It invested in smartphone maker Meizu and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/25/us-alibaba-chinatelecom-idUSKBN0NG06120150425">partnered</a> with China Telecom to sell cheap smartphones preloaded with software. It entered into talks to buy India smartphone maker Micromax for as much as $1.2 billion and may also <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-foxconn-in-talks-to-invest-500-million-in-indias-snapdeal-1434444149">join</a> a $500 million round for India&#8217;s Snapdeal.</p> <p>Alibaba <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/us-alibaba-snapchat-idUSKBN0M72L320150312">invested</a> $200 million in Snapchat, following a $50 million investment in smart-remote app Peel. Then it <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/report-alibaba-investing-in-amazon-competitor-jetcom-2015-4">participated</a> in a $140 million round raised by Amazon-challenger Jet.com around the time it became<a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/alibaba-buys-48m-zulily-shares-for-56m/"> Zulilly&#8217;s largest outside shareholder</a>. In China, it has invested in hotel-management software company Beijing Shiji, delivery service YTO Express, and media companies Shanghai Media and Alibaba Pictures Group. And there are many more.</p> <p>Beyond investments, Alibaba has been laying other plans. The company is working to sign up <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/us-alibaba-bmg-idUSKBN0MQ0UH20150330">music-distribution</a> deals with major labels, add Alipay to 410 Wal-Mart stores in China, launch a Netflix-like video service called TBO, and produce a facial-recognition app that lets shoppers <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/30/us-alibaba-bmg-idUSKBN0MQ0UH20150330">pay by smiling</a>.</p> <p>What kind of a picture do we get when we connect all of these scattered dots? Nothing terribly clear, but a few things stand out. First, Alibaba&#8217;s core marketplaces are rooted in a vision in which consumers can immerse themselves in a mobile world and buy whatever strikes their fancy – with Alibaba as the platform running the whole show. It&#8217;s adding layer after layer onto that core vision.</p> <p>Second, Alibaba is dead serious about expanding internationally. It can&#8217;t easily export the e-commerce platform it built in China, so it&#8217;s exporting its ecosystem. And if it can&#8217;t to that, it will build another ecosystem based on companies that it has minority investments in. Minority investments are either just that – opportunities to see returns on your capital – or they are the mortar binding together partnerships. Unless Alibaba wants to be a hedge fund, its strategy is almost certainly the latter.</p> <p>These days, growing your ecosystem is the name of the game for the biggest tech giants, even if it means straying into each other domains or new market entirely. But there is a risk of pushing too quickly into too many competitive markets. As Amazon found out it can <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-spending-leads-to-another-loss-1414095239">lead to growing losses</a> and money poured into unloved things like, say, the Amazon Phone. In that sense, Alibaba may become the Amazon of China after all.</p> <p>Unlike Amazon, which is building its empire by itself, Alibaba is cobbling together a sprawling ecosystem through minority investments and partnerships. One advantage is that it could end up with the kind of lucrative investment that Yahoo found in Alibaba back in 2005. Should Snapchat go public and see its stock surge, it could deliver benefits to Alibaba beyond the strategic.</p> <p>Partnering with Alibaba may bring its own two-edged blade. As investors in the IPO found out quickly, this is one opaque company, and figuring out what&#8217;s going on inside it – or even who is driving the decisions – isn&#8217;t easy. Alibaba has other baggage as well, such as rising scrutiny from government officials, an ongoing scourge of counterfeit goods and a stock price that is down nearly 30 percent since last November.</p> <p>Alibaba may well recover from or push through all those concerns. The bigger question is how it can craft a coherent strategy from all of the different pots it&#8217;s sticking its fingers into. Ecommerce is becoming a moble, global phenomenon, which Alibaba understands as well as everyone. The company will without question be a big player. But by running in so many directions as the same time, it may easily become distracted along the way.</p> <div id="author-info"> <h3>Kevin Kelleher</h3> <div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;"> <img width="100" height="100" src="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/k7.jpg?w=100&#038;h=100" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="k7" /> </div> Kevin Kelleher is a writer living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It&#8217;s basically the Dropcam Pro with a few updates and a slightly different name.</p> <p>Nest Cam doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise. Google acquired Dropcam shortly after it acquired Nest, and earlier this year, Dropcam users were required to abandon the old subscription service and create accounts with their camera&#8217;s new king.</p> <p>But don&#8217;t mistake inevitable change for welcome progress. Dropcam merging with Nest &#8212; and both companies existing solely because Google knows it can&#8217;t yet release home cameras with its own branding &#8212; is still a little unnerving.</p> <p>As I explained <a href="http://pando.com/2014/05/27/if-google-buys-dropcam-say-goodbye-to-privacy-forever/">back when reports</a> about Google acquiring Dropcam surfaced:</p> <blockquote><p>I shouldn’t have to explain why budding interest in security cameras from a company whose entire business model revolves around the systematic degradation of individual privacy is a bad thing, but I’ll give it a shot anyway. Google’s future depends on new and exciting ways to get advertisements in front of consumers. Serving those advertisements requires the collection of increasing amounts of information, which creates a never-ending cycle of data vacuuming.</p> <p>It’s bad enough that this company is entrusted with the world’s largest mobile software platform, the premier search engine, and services on which many consumers rely, such as Gmail and Google Maps. Now it’s offering thermostats and might be getting into the home security business — in addition to creating self-driving cars and technologies that consumers will have tattooed on their arms or sitting in their stomachs. ‘Panopticon’ doesn’t even come close to describing it.</p></blockquote> <p>Since then, Dropcam users <a href="http://pando.com/2015/03/06/dropcams-slow-slide-into-nest-and-therefore-google-begins/">have been asked</a> to use Nest&#8217;s services, and Dropcam itself has now been transmogrified into the Nest Cam. Oh, and Nest&#8217;s terms of service <a href="http://pando.com/2014/06/24/once-a-trailblazer-nest-is-now-three-moves-behind-oh-and-it-will-share-data-with-google/">have been updated</a> to allow &#8220;limited&#8221; information sharing with Google.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a smart play on Google&#8217;s part. Acquire a few decent startups, use their brands to avoid making consumers uneasy about allowing Google products into their homes, then combine them before ultimately folding it into Google when people have grown used to having these devices watch their every waking move.</p> <p>Here&#8217;s to playing the long game, Google! No, wait, sorry, Nest.</p> <div id="author-info"> <h3>Nathaniel Mott</h3> <div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;"> <img width="100" height="100" src="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/nathan.jpg?w=100&#038;h=100" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="nathaniel" /> </div> Nathaniel Mott is a staff writer for PandoDaily, covering startups and technology from New York. </div><!-- #author-info --><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170151&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/475d4c11/sc/23/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231042008205/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c11/sc/23/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/18/nest-absorbs-dropcam-releases-its-own-home-security-camera/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Nathaniel Mott</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/nestimage.png?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/nestimage.png?w=100"><media:title type="html">Nestimage</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/728b94b5fd5bcafaaf85deacd6159edb?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">nathanielmott</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/nestimage.png"><media:title type="html">Nestimage</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>The Internet and the Things have come together in IdeaPaint’s new app Bounce</title><link>http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/475d4c16/sc/28/l/0Lpando0N0C20A150C0A60C180Cthe0Einternet0Eand0Ethe0Ethings0Ehave0Ecome0Etogether0Ein0Eideapaints0Enew0Eapp0Ebounce0C/story01.htm</link><description>IdeaPaint, the whiteboard paint company, has always had a close relationship to the startup and technology world.

Many of its first clients were Internet companies looking to turn every single space in their offices into a brainstorming or ideation canvas.</p> <p>Today, the company is launching its own mobile app, called <a href="http://bounce.ideapaint.com/">Bounce</a>, to make anything written on its whiteboard walls recordable and shareable for companies to more easily collaborate on projects.</p> <p>One of the key features of the app is that the images and the information recorded in those images can be annotated and allows ideas and meetings that feature whiteboard sessions searchable. The app also allows users to add and annotate what has been recorded from a whiteboard session.</p> <p>According to IdeaPaint CEO John Stephans, the company developed its own app because many of the organizations that use its paint products were asking the company to find a way to take the information that had been written on its walls to a shared, collaborative platform. &#8220;Our customers have told us that IdeaPaint is unbelievable for the amount of energy it brings to a company&#8217;s thinking and the amount of actions that come out of that thinking,&#8221; Stephans said. &#8220;They wanted to find a way to keep the momentum from their meetings going long after those sessions ended and to be able to share them with people who weren&#8217;t involved in person.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The app allowed us to build functionality to take those sessions from the wall to a company&#8217;s various teams, whether they were in the meeting or not, all the way to those ideas were actioned,&#8221; Stephans added.</p> <p>IdeaPaint has 150,000 of its premium dry erase paint installations around the world which can turn any smooth surface into an erasable whiteboard. Bounce was developed in collaboration with well-known Boston advertising firm Hill Holliday&#8217;s innovation lab Project Beacon.</p> <p>&#8220;We always have considered ourselves a communication technology company,&#8221; said Stephans. &#8220;We have thought about how we expand our offerings to our customers and how we can stay out in front our how our customers collaborate and communicate. Bounce fits clearly into the entire tech ecosystem.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You can have now have an session on the IdeaPaint wall, capture it, and then start sharing it with Bounce,&#8221; Stephans said.</p> <p>The app in its current state is a interesting addition to IdeaPaint&#8217;s paint products and an effort from the company to expand its brand identity. Additionally, due to the number of organizations that already have used its paint products, it has the ability to push the app out as a communication and collaboration tool to its existing partners.</p> <p>But, when it comes down to it, Bounce is just a glorified note taking app. If the company can add other features, it could continue to grow as a leader in the meeting and collaboration space.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170122&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/475d4c16/sc/28/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231042008204/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/475d4c16/sc/28/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/18/the-internet-and-the-things-have-come-together-in-ideapaints-new-app-bounce/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Dennis Keohane</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-18-at-12-13-11-pm.png?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-18-at-12-13-11-pm.png?w=100"><media:title type="html">Screen Shot 2015-06-18 at 12.13.11 PM</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/85b6094b53e244a395c8b5488021dc66?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">denbkeohane</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-18-at-12-13-11-pm.png"><media:title type="html">Screen Shot 2015-06-18 at 12.13.11 PM</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Pandoland 2015 startup battle has a winner!</title><link>http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/47570d30/sc/13/l/0Lpando0N0C20A150C0A60C170Cpandoland0E20A150Estartup0Ebattle0Ehas0Ea0Ewinner0C/story01.htm</link><description>The Pandoland 2015 Startup competition has drawn to a close, and our lucky winner is&amp;#8230; &lt;a href="http://umano.com/"&gt;umano&lt;/a&gt;!

This morning that ongoing dialogue made a tour stop on stage at <a href="http://www.pandoland2015.com/">Pandoland in Nashville</a>.</p> <p>Vargas updated Sarah Lacy on his work since their first on-stage interview in November and his appearance at Pando’s <a href="https://sponsored.pando.com/event/dont-be-awful/">Don’t Be Awful</a> fest this past winter. In a gut-punching reversal, he still has been unable to visit his mother in the Philippines, whom he hasn’t seen in 22 years. The last time Vargas spoke with Pando, an executive order had opened the door for him to make the long-awaited trip. It still hasn’t happened: That presidential order was blocked <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/17/federal-judge-in-texas-blocks-obama-immigration-orders/">in February</a> by a federal court in Texas, leaving Vargas and an estimated 4.3 million other undocumented Americans waiting in the wings for their promised status-change to take effect.</p> <p>Of course, that hasn’t slowed the guy down a bit.</p> <p>Among his many projects and speaking engagements, Vargas has delivered a film to MTV focusing on talking to white people about issues of race and immigration.</p> <p>“People of color and immigrants always get asked, ‘where are you from?’ We never seem to ask white people that question,” Vargas said to the crowd members at Pandoland, the majority of whom were white. “I just find that so interesting. I know where I’m from. I know how I got here, and I know who paid for it. And I think if we are really going to talk about immigration, if we are really going to talk about race in this country, we can’t have that conversation and not talk to white people about it.”</p> <p>Details of this “whiteness project” will be announced tomorrow by MTV, and the program will air later this summer. With his sails full of urgent purpose, Vargas rests on no laurels. He will also helm a new magazine about race, immigration and identity for the LA Times called #emergingus.</p> <p>“Basically &#8216;all-things-Rachel-Dolezal&#8217; happening right now&#8230; #emergingus is video first, it has video and engagement at its heart,” he said of the new project.</p> <p>Much of his production falls under the umbrella of his own company, Undocumented LLC. (“I’m a job creator, yo,” he said). He’s also done around 400 events with his non-profit DefineAmerican, of which he said, “It’s important to preach beyond the choir.” And he’s sought after in advisory and advocacy roles by a number of outfits, including FWD.us, his involvement with which he briefly sketched for the audience.</p> <p>“The moment FWD.us only becomes about H1B visas for engineers, I will be the very first person to criticize them. It has to be about all of us. Engineers are important, but immigration is not just about that. FWD has been broad and inclusive. I wish sometimes that they could be bolder but look: our politicians, our politics are not bold. they are working within the system and its a compromised, mediocre system.”</p> <p>Though his work populates a number of platforms and is conveyed in various media, it centers on a determination to keep immigration from falling off the cultural radar during gaps in the news cycle, and to broaden and develop the way these issues are discussed when they inevitably return to the country’s front pages.</p> <p>“We have a farce here. You know, there are 12 million undocumented people like me in this country, about 160,000 of us in Tennessee. I mean, you know we’re here. You know we’re working. You know we’re driving. We go to the same church. So what do you want to do with us? You know, we can’t all mow your lawns and babysit your kids and serve you drinks. Or is that what you want us to do? So I actually called the government and was like, ‘Hi, I haven’t heard from you. What do you wanna do?”</p> <p>“The woman from Homeland Security said ‘no comment,’ and you know I think ‘no comment’ is a metaphor for how people think of us. There is no sense of urgency. Every day that we’re sitting here, someone is getting deported and separated from their family. So I outed myself to make a statement and to tell people that this issue isn’t what they think it is.”</p> <p>He framed the new ‘Southern Question’ for the mostly local crowd.</p> <p>“All of these southern states are being remade by immigration. In Nashville I just heard that one in eight people in Nashville is an immigrant. One of the fastest growing immigrant cities in the South. So, when we talk about race how do we make sure we are broadening the conversation?”</p> <p>He doesn’t take his role lightly.</p> <p>“I find that whole thing about being comfortable with being the agent of your own story so uncomfortable&#8230; for me it’s a question of ‘am I passing the bullshit meter?’ How do I make sure that when I use ‘I’, ‘me’ and ‘my’ &#8212; the three most dangerous words in the English language &#8212; that I earn it? That it’s not just self-serving cesspool of narcissism? How do I tell a very specific story and tie it to a universal truth? How do I make sure I am opening a conversation?”</p> <p>Vargas gave several examples of what that openness to conversation looks like. For the past four years, he’s been criss-crossing the country, visiting his mission upon Tea Party rallies, political campaign events, college campuses, and broadcasts. However, his desire for dialogue does have some limits.</p> <p>“If it’s Ann Coulter you walk away.

But it’s something more than that: a glorious victory. That’s not something I get to write very often.</p> <p>Most war stories are the dead opposite of glorious. You start out, as a war-nerdy kid, believing that Gettysburg is the norm—a good clean fight between brave, simple soldiers, ferocious against each other but sparing non-combatants. There was exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginnie_Wade">one civilian death</a> at Gettysburg, and that was from a stray bullet.</p> <p>Then you get serious about warfare and realize that massacre is the norm, genocide is more common than anyone wants to realize, and most conflicts are bad vs. bad, or bad vs. even worse.</p> <p>But not this time. The war between the Syrian Kurds and Islamic State is as close to good vs. evil as you’ll ever meet in the grown-up world. The YPG/J are <a href="http://kurdishquestion.com/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/ypj-commander-isis-attacked-with-turkey-s-assistance/729-ypj-commander-isis-attacked-with-turkey-s-assistance.html">radical feminists</a>, with women fighting on the front lines and even commanding whole fronts; Islamic State takes misogyny to a new level, actually boasting in their glossy magazine Dabiq about the righteousness of <a href="http://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2014/10/13/435ff091-1382-4768-898d-12f609a102a6/435ff091-1382-4768-898d-12f609a102a6_4x3_296x222.jpg">selling captured women</a> as sex slaves.</p> <p>I’d be wary of believing that the YPG/J are as good as they seem, except that I lived among Kurds. They really are heroic people. No doubt there are bad Kurds, and there have certainly been evil things done by Kurdish people, like serving as <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/armenian-genocide-kurdish-leaders-set-moral-example-turkey-by-facing-their-crimes-1498053">enforcers</a> for the Turks during the Armenian Genocide.</p> <p>But Kurds are working very hard, and fighting heroically, to change themselves and their world; for starters, they’re still the only participants in the Armenian Genocide who’ve acknowledged their role. And the rate of social change, especially in the role of women, in Kurdish culture is approaching light speed.</p> <p>Islamic State, meanwhile, represents the most extreme reactionary position in the Middle East. Even the way the latest campaign between Islamic State and the YPG/J developed shows just how friggin’ evil Islamic State is. After being <a href="http://pando.com/2014/10/16/the-war-nerd-nobody-could-have-predicted-islamic-states-retreat-from-kobane-except-me/">humiliated at Kobane</a>, IS’s leaders wanted a cheap, quick victory to erase the shameful memory. After all, those Qatari, Saudi, and Kuwaiti billionaires aren’t going to keep funding your jihad if you keep getting shown up, especially when it’s mere women doing the showing-up.</p> <p>So IS decided to do what it does best: Wipe out a minority sect. And they chose the Assyrian Christian villages that cluster to the west of the provincial capital, Hasakah, as a perfect target. The Assyrians have been targeted in sectarian pogroms for centuries; they’re a peaceful, quiet people, just like the Yazidii minority that IS destroyed in Iraq. Just the kind of kaffirs that IS loves to massacre and enslave.</p> <p>IS <a href="http://pando.com/2014/10/16/the-war-nerd-nobody-could-have-predicted-islamic-states-retreat-from-kobane-except-me/">fled Kobane</a> at the end of January 2015, and by the end of February, IS had shifted men and weapons to the front west of Hasakah, planning to overrun the strip of Assyrian-Christian villages along the Khabour River. (By the way, if you want to see what happened via carefully sequenced battle-maps, go to the excellent site <a href="http://www.agathocledesyracuse.com/archives/282">“Agathocle de Syracuse”</a> and click on “Hasakah Western Front.”)</p> <p>The geography is a little complicated here. As you can see on <a href="http://www.agathocledesyracuse.com/archives/366">this excellent map</a> (also courtesy of “Agothocle de Syracuse”), the Syrian Kurds control three enclaves or “cantons,” all along the Turkish border: Afrin in the northwest, up against Hatay Province (Hatay is a story in itself, one <a href="https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/cleanse-thy-neighbor/">I’ve written about</a> before); Kobane in the center; and Hasakah in the east. Hasakah is the biggest Kurdish enclave, and the most important, since it joins the KRG region controlled by the Iraqi Kurds. Those Iraqi Kurds are much more conservative than the young women and men of the YPG/J, but there’s still some solidarity there, and some quiet resupply going on.</p> <p>Islamic State holds the center of the country, along the Euphrates River, and the border area due west of Iraq’s Nineveh Province, south of the Kurdish enclave in Hasakah. So, by attacking along the Khabour, IS was punching up, like a good leftist (bitter Hebdo joke; never mind)—that is, attacking due north.</p> <p>IS is media-savvy as all Hell; it runs on victory videos. A campaign against a helpless minority like the Assyrians would mean lots of good video, plenty of loot, and thousands of new slave girls to sell.</p> <p>They might even have thought that the Kurds of the YPG/J wouldn’t fight too hard to defend mere non-Kurdish, non-Muslim neighbors. Few communities in that part of the world put themselves at risk to help neighbors of a different ethnic group or religion.</p> <p>But the Kurds…I’m telling you, the Kurds are something special. I saw it myself. In Suli, my students would say, “I have Christian (Assyrian) friends!” or “I have Shia (Arab, refugee from Southern Iraq) friends!”</p> <p>When I told people back in America about those remarks, they had a hard time seeing anything very radical or impressive about them. People shrugged, as if it was banal or fake.</p> <p>It’s hard to get some people to realize that not every place is America. In Iraq, calling someone from a different sect/ethnic group a “friend” is heroic. And not something you see, in other parts of the Middle East.</p> <p>The Kurds are trying very hard to change, to get out of the sectarian nightmare. So when Islamic State attacked those vulnerable Assyrian villages around the town of Tal Hamer, they fought for the Assyrians.</p> <p>It must have been a surprise for the sectarian scum of IS. People like that tend to judge everyone by themselves. And the history around there is pretty grimly sectarian, right down the centuries. “Tal,” the first word of most town names in the region, means “man-made hill,” or “old fort.” (“Tel Aviv” comes from the same Semitic root.) You build your town on a defensive mound, and you kill your neighbors of the wrong language/religion when you can.</p> <p>Not the Kurds, though. Not this time. They fought for the Assyrians, and helped the “fledging” (i.e. “pretty well useless”) Assyrian militias. Assyrian civilians had been evacuated to the provincial capital in advance, so IS captured few women to sell or men to behead. They had to settle for blowing up the church in the Assyrian village of Tal Nasri (“hill-mound of the Christians”).</p> <p>IS advanced slowly through March and April, and almost had the town of Tal Tamer cut off. The YPG/J allowed the bulge to develop, then hit back hard at the beginning of May 2015, slicing in from the northwest, cutting IS’s main supply line and leaving hundreds of IS isolated in a pocket around Tal Tamer.</p> <p>I haven’t been able to find out what happened to those IS fighters in the pocket, but it’s a fair bet that their beards have finally stopped growing.</p> <p>By attacking the Assyrian villages along the Khabour, IS had let its sectarian hatred blind it to basic strategic rules. Islamic State’s top priority should have been to defend and extend its link to Turkey, which runs north from Raqqa through Tal Abyad via Highway 6, and prevent the Syrian Kurds from linking up their “cantons” along the Syrian/Turkish border. If <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/32120/world-war-i-centennial-schlieffen-dead-his-plan-lives">Schlieffen</a> had been an Islamic State strategist, he would’ve said, “Keep the northeastern front strong” on his deathbed.</p> <p>Instead, Islamic State had shifted men and vehicles south, to the Tal Tamer front, leaving the northern flank, along the Turkish border, weakened.</p> <p>And that’s how the YPG/J was able to take Tal Abyad this week. Once IS’s attack to the south was contained, YPG/J rolled west along the border zone relatively easily. IS has a rep for fighting to the death, but they seem to have lost the will to fight lately, especially when up against YPG/J.</p> <p>And thanks to their earlier victory in Kobane, YPG/J was able to close in on Tal Abyad from the west, at the same time as its Hasakah forces were advancing along the border from the east. Kobane may have vanished from the headlines, but the young women and men who liberated it never stopped fighting, advancing west, south, and east from Kobane.</p> <p>With Kurdish forces pushing east along the border from Kobane and west from Hasakah, Islamic State was barely holding on to a Polish-Corridor style strip of territory around Tal Abyad, by the end of May 2015.</p> <p>On June 11, YPG/J and its FSA allies overran the town of Suluk, a few kilometers southeast of Tal Abyad. By this point, Islamic State was acting like a defeated force, blowing up bridges to stall the advance of YPG/J and trying to <a href="http://www.trendsmania.com/trends/turkish">corral fleeing civilians</a> back into Tal Abyad.</p> <p>And yesterday, June 15, 2015, a day that will live in the opposite of infamy (“famy”?), the YPG/J took full <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-driven-out-of-syrian-town-of-tal-abyad-by-kurds-and-rebels-near-turkish-border-10322472.html">control of Tal Abyad</a>, finally uniting the Kurdish enclaves of Kobane and Hasakah (“Jazira”) and destroying the jihadi corridor from Turkey to Raqqa.</p> <p>Now, IS will have a much harder time keeping the flow of gullible cannon fodder coming in from Turkey.</p> <p>All the right people are cheering, and all the wrong ones are crying, from Erdogan’s hick reactionaries in Ankara to the fat money men in the Gulf. This is the rarest thing in all of warfare, a truly glorious victory.

Almost as if they were discussing Voldemort, Shellhammer and Lacy occasionally alluded to his previous endeavor, Fab.com, while avoiding saying the company&#8217;s name aloud.</p> <p>&#8220;When he&#8217;s talking about &#8216;last time,'&#8221; Lacy finally said, &#8220;he means Fab, which I think is the first dead unicorn.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so sad,&#8221; Shellhammer responded, &#8220;A dead unicorn. Not Fab, but the visual of dead unicorn is so upsetting to me.&#8221;</p> <p>As Lacy explained, &#8220;Fab has become the poster child people talk about when they talk about excesses.&#8221; The company raised $336 million in funding, with a valuation over $1 billion, but fell hard after some departures of key employees &#8212; including Shellhammer who was the company&#8217;s chief creative officer &#8212; and a business model that hemorrhaged money. Last fall, Fab was acquired by PCH International for $15 million, a shocking amount based on the valuation that investors had previously given the company.</p> <p>&#8220;Some things worked, and some things don&#8217;t,&#8221; Shellhammer said about Fab. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t become what other people and we thought it was going to become.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t walk around with this cloud over may head, saying, &#8216;God, I wish things could have been different,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I walk around enlightened now, but it took awhile to get there.&#8221;</p> <p>So what did Shellhammer do after leaving Fab?</p> <blockquote><p>It was very cliche. I went and sat on a beach for three weeks. It was a punch in the gut, almost like a breakup almost. But then you emerge from that a much stronger person. And I realized a lot about myself, and about what actually satisfies me and makes me happy as human being, even though my job is to sell things to the world, is not about consumption,it&#8217;s not about the things you collect, it&#8217;s not about money, it&#8217;s not about power, it&#8217;s not about being on stage or on the cover of a magazine. It&#8217;s all about the connections with people. Being on top of the world and all that going away, I went from being real pp</p> <p>It was in the moment of people leaving me alone that I realized the things that are important in life are my connections to other people, to my friends.</p> <p>Yeah, Fab is a case study in every business school now, but my life has changed because of it, so I have nothing but positive feelings about the experience.</p></blockquote> <p>Lacy then said that among investors there was a lot of opinions that what happened to Fab was self-inflicted. &#8220;When did it start veering from being something everyone loved,&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Was it that e-commerce is so hard?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The lessons learned were that retail businesses take a lot longer than some other business to build,&#8221; Shellhammer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big ask to ask for people&#8217;s money, especially for a trinket or a ceramic vase. It takes time to gain that trust.&#8221;</p> <p>Shellhammer added, &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s not an appetite among some in the venture community to give these things time to grow.&#8221;</p> <p>He also said that they started Bezar because there are still people who appreciate design and want products from &#8220;the world of designers who have this surplus of products that they can&#8217;t get into people&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p> <p><em>[photo by Geoffrey Ellis]</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=pando.com&#038;blog=30860228&#038;post=170124&#038;subd=pandodaily&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><img width='1' height='1' src='http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/47549db0/sc/23/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><a href="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://rc.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/></a><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/231041953714/u/0/f/650422/c/35141/s/47549db0/sc/23/a2t.img" border="0"/>]]></content:encoded><slash:comments>0</slash:comments><wfw:commentRss>http://pando.com/2015/06/17/from-the-mouth-of-a-dead-unicorn-bradford-shellhammer-talks-about-the-last-days-of-fab-and-being-enlightened/feed/</wfw:commentRss><dc:creator>Dennis Keohane</dc:creator><media:thumbnail url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bradford_mg_7406_web.jpg?w=100" /><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bradford_mg_7406_web.jpg?w=100"><media:title type="html">Bradford_MG_7406_web</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/85b6094b53e244a395c8b5488021dc66?s=96&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=G"><media:title type="html">denbkeohane</media:title></media:content><media:content lang="" url="https://pandodaily.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bradford_mg_7406_web.jpg?w=600"><media:title type="html">Bradford_MG_7406_web</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Uber’s drivers are employees, not “contractors”: California labor commission ruling</title><link>http://pandodaily.com.feedsportal.com/c/35141/f/650422/s/475369df/sc/15/l/0Lpando0N0C20A150C0A60C170Cubers0Edrivers0Eare0Eemployees0Enot0Econtractors0Ecalifornia0Elabor0Ecommission0Eruling0C/story01.htm</link><description>Uber’s business model—skim profits off drivers, while avoiding the expenses that come with hiring drivers as employees—just suffered a major blow: the California labor commission has just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/611175621276909568"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Uber’s drivers are, in fact, employees, not contractors.

Uber, which has seen its valuation soar to over <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/11/investing/uber-50-billion-valuation/">$50 billion</a>, can no longer claim that it is just a nifty little app that happens to pair up micro-entrepreneurial drivers and consumers, thereby avoiding the expenses and laws that other transportation and logistics companies have to bear.</p> <p>The ruling will significantly impact Uber’s valuation, now that they’ll have to pay and treat their drivers like employees.</p> <p>To be fair to Uber, it’s not the only transportation company that’s tried to squeeze more profits on the backs of its workers by misclassifying them as contractors. Last week, FedEx agreed to pay <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2015/06/12/fedex-settlement-drivers-independent-contractors.html">$228 million</a> to settle a class action suit filed by its drivers for wrongly classifying them as independent contractors rather than employees. Last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Court-to-FedEx-Your-drivers-are-full-time-5717048.php">ruled</a> against FedEx’s argument that its drivers were not employees, despite driving in FedEx trucks and wearing FedEx uniforms.</p> <p>FedEx is a massive business, and can survive the loss of some profits; but for Uber the entire business model &#8212; profit without the labor expenses &#8212; will have to be reworked. Uber will now have to hire its California drivers and comply with California labor laws — that means better pay, workers comp, health care, sick leave, taxes . . . and it also means Uber will have to consider covering the costs of their employees’ vehicles.</p> <p>The sharing economy could be turning around—Uber’s investors will now have to share more of those juicy profits with a large pool of workers.</p> <p>UPDATE: Uber released a <a href="http://newsroom.uber.com/2015/06/clcstatement/">statement</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Reuters’ original headline was not accurate. The California Labor Commission’s ruling is non-binding and applies to a single driver. Indeed it is contrary to a previous ruling by the same commission, which concluded in 2012 that the driver ‘performed services as an independent contractor, and not as a bona fide employee.’ Five other states have also come to the same conclusion. It’s important to remember that the number one reason drivers choose to use Uber is because they have complete flexibility and control. The majority of them can and do choose to earn their living from multiple sources, including other ride sharing companies. We have appealed this ruling.</p></blockquote> <p>And here&#8217;s a copy of today&#8217;s ruling:</p> <form id="wpcom-iframe-form-bfd32437ac91be7519661af25d37c44f-558460435b53d" target="wpcom-iframe-bfd32437ac91be7519661af25d37c44f-558460435b53d" method="post" action="//wpcomwidgets.com/?wpcom_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fpandodaily.wordpress.com" style="display: none"> <input type="hidden" name="width" value="100%" /> <input type="hidden" name="height" value="1000" /> <input type="hidden" name="frameborder" value="0" /> <input type="hidden" name="style" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="class" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="scrolling" value="no" /> <input type="hidden" name="webkitallowfullscreen" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="mozallowfullscreen" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="allowfullscreen" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="resize" value="0" /> <input type="hidden" name="replace_attributes" value="1" /> <input type="hidden" name="fallback" value="&#60;p class=&#34;protected-embed-fallback&#34;&#62;This embed is invalid&#60;/p&#62;" /> <input type="hidden" name="_data" value="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,91839a96270f725b16352670009b1c774aef2b91" /> <input type="hidden" name="_tag" value="protected-iframe" /> <input type="hidden" name="_hash" value="bfd32437ac91be7519661af25d37c44f" /> </form> <iframe name="wpcom-iframe-bfd32437ac91be7519661af25d37c44f-558460435b53d" id="wpcom-iframe-bfd32437ac91be7519661af25d37c44f-558460435b53d" width="100%" height="1000" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wpcom-protected-iframe "></iframe> <script type="text/javascript"> ( function() { var func = function() { var iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-bfd32437ac91be7519661af25d37c44f-558460435b53d');
