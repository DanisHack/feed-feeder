To avoid the <a href="http://qz.com/612279/chinas-crisis-europes-debt-and-the-us-oil-bust-have-become-one-big-worldwide-mess/">turmoil in financial markets</a>, your best bet might be sneakers. Specifically, those made by the <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/63189-kanye-west-viciously-attacks-wiz-khalifa-in-incredible-twitter-rant/">greatest artist of all time</a>—or at least of the 21st century.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now they know <a href="https://t.co/6c3OXYmkPG">pic.twitter.com/6c3OXYmkPG</a></p>
<p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/697185038350360577">February 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Kanye West was behind six of the 10 most valuable sneakers last year, according to <a href="http://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/02/01/most-expensive-sneakers-2015/">High Snobiety and sneakerhead data site Campless</a>. His YEEZY Boost Adidas sneakers are among the most coveted in the world. And anyone who has got their hands on them did quite well—provided they haven&#8217;t actually been worn.</p>
<p>The YEEZY Boost 750 “Triple Black” is the most expensive in the range, with an average &#8220;deadstock&#8221; (meaning <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Deadstock">as new</a>, still in the box) price of $1,876 on eBay at the end of 2015. The shoes sold at a retail price of $350—meaning that you could have made a return of 436% almost instantly. The man known as Yeezus was only slightly exaggerating <a href="http://genius.com/Kanye-west-all-day-lyrics">when he said</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>People saying, &#8220;Ye, Ye, take it easy&#8221;<br />
20 Gs for the YEEZYs off of eBay</p></blockquote>
<p>And those sneakers were only released in December. You would be hard pressed to find another asset that gained as much value last year; stocks were mixed, bonds went sideways, and commodities were hit hard. Gold, the traditional safe haven in times of turmoil, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-31/gold-loses-luster-for-third-straight-year-as-investors-sell">fell by more than 10%</a> during the year.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="NJqWR4H9x" data-width="640" data-height="486"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_NJqWR4H9x.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>Why are West&#8217;s sneakers doing so well? In short, scarcity. YEEZYs are extremely hard to come by—so much so that GQ recommends you <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/kanye-adidas-yeezy-boost-350-sneaker-black-buy">enter raffles to get a pair</a> when they come out. The second-most valuable sneaker is a special Nike Air released exclusively in China.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data->
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">@ fitting <a href="https://t.co/dVS7sedQVH">pic.twitter.com/dVS7sedQVH</a></p>
<p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/696813552020123648">February 8, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another crazy thing is that only one Air Jordan made the top 10 in the Campless list last year—an incredible coup for West, given that Michael Jordan&#8217;s shoe brand is historically beloved by sneakerheads. Then again, West <a href="http://genius.com/Kanye-west-new-god-flow-lyrics">did once say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hold up, I ain&#8217;t trying to stunt, man<br />
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman</p></blockquote>
<p>Tonight (Feb. 11), West will unveil the <a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a13679/yeezy-season-3/">third season of his YEEZY collection</a> and his new album (<a href="http://nahright.com/2016/02/09/the-name-of-kanyes-album-doesnt-matter/">whatever it&#8217;s called</a>) in Madison Square Garden in New York. While everyone else looks at the clothes, keep an eye <a href="http://tidal.com/gb/yeezyseason3">on the free livestream</a> for what&#8217;s on West&#8217;s feet. There&#8217;s money to be made from following in his footsteps.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=614202&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>What to watch for today</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Global stocks are tumbling again.</strong> The Stoxx Europe 600 is down by 3.5%, as US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen&#8217;s comments <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-slide-after-fed-sparks-investor-concerns-1455181311">did little to reassure investors</a> (paywall). Earlier, Hong Kong&#8217;s benchmark<span class="s1"> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-11/hong-kong-stock-futures-plunge-as-markets-reopen-after-holidays">dropped by 3.9%</a> after being closed for three days—the biggest fall to start a Chinese new year since 1994. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The so-called “Oregon Militia” step down.</strong> The three remaining armed men and one woman, who have occupied a state wildlife reserve for 40 days, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35547168">will leave the complex</a> this morning. Several have already left after protesting government land rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>The anti-ISIL coalition meets in Brussels.</strong> Defense ministers from 66 countries will meet at <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_127760.htm">NATO headquarters</a> to discuss the conflict in Syria. US defense secretary Ash Carter is expected to share plans to retake parts of Syria and Iraq from ISIL, and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/us-fight-36796513">call upon other nations</a> to play a bigger role against the group.</p>
<p><strong>A huge discovery could reaffirm Albert Einstein’s genius.</strong> A team of US physicists is expected to announce the discovery of clear, unambiguous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/09/watch-this-spacetime-gravitational-wave-discovery-expected">evidence of gravitational waves</a>, 100 years after the physicist first predicted their existence. The team’s work could earn them a Nobel Prize, if it holds up.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><strong>One of the last remaining Nazis goes on trial.</strong> Reinhold Hanning, a 94-year-old who worked at the Auschwitz concentration camp, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35547032">is accused of being an accessory</a> to the murder of 170,000 people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Earnings, earnings, earnings.</strong> Investors in Activision Blizzard will <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-day-ahead-thursday-feb-193841725.html">expect an update</a> on the $5.9-billion acquisition of smartphone-game maker King Digital. </span>PepsiCo is expected to offset a <a href="http://qz.com/602783/big-soda-now-has-a-planet-sized-problem-on-its-hands/">global decline in demand</a> for fizzy, sugary drinks with strong results from its <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-to-expect-from-pepsicos-earnings-2016-02-09">massive snacks unit</a>. <span class="s1">AIG, CBS, Thompson Reuters, and Time Inc. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-day-ahead-thursday-feb-193841725.html">also report earnings</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>While you were sleeping</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Suicide bombers killed at least 60 in Nigeria.</strong> The female attackers <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0VK0EN">targeted a camp for people displaced</a> by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group. Almost 80 people were injured in the explosions, which took place in the northeastern town of Dikwa.</p>
<p><strong>Hong Kong began charging rioters.</strong> The first of 37 people arrested on charges of <a href="http://qz.com/612813/hong-kongs-fishball-revolution-is-about-a-lot-more-than-just-street-food/">rioting earlier this week</a> was <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1911876/hong-kong-courtroom-packed-37-face-rioting-charges-and-are">barred from entering</a> (paywall) a part of the city where the violence took place. Defendants accused the police of violence and of sleep deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>North and South Korea shut down a joint business park.</strong> The South is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35547145">clearing out removable items</a> after the North said it would close the business and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-11/north-korea-to-shut-industrial-park-freeze-south-korean-assets">freeze South Korean assets</a>. The fallout comes after the North launched a satellite into orbit on Sunday. Separately, the US voted to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/10/reports-north-korean-army-chief-executed/80166884/">increase sanctions against North Korea</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rio Tinto detailed an awful year for raw materials. </strong>The world&#8217;s second-largest miner reported a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rio-tinto-results-idUSL3N15O3RJ">net loss of $866 million in 2015</a>, after commodity prices spent the year in a rut. But Rio maintained its dividend for the year ahead at the same rate as last year, while its peers are expected to cut theirs.</p>
<p><strong>Socété Générale made a weaker-than-expected profit.</strong> The French bank&#8217;s fourth-quarter net income <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-societegenerale-results-idUKKCN0VK0C8">rose to €656 million</a> ($741.5 million), from €549 million a year earlier, after it set aside an extra €400 million to cover litigation costs.</p>
<p><strong>The State Bank of India reported terrible quarter.</strong> The country&#8217;s largest lender posted a <a href="http://qz.com/614971/quarterly-profits-at-indias-biggest-bank-have-fallen-by-a-jaw-dropping-62/">net income of 11.2 billion rupees</a> ($164 million) for the final three months of 2015, a 62% drop from a year earlier. A jump in bad loans hurt the bank&#8217;s profit, which was the slowest in four years.</p>

<p><strong>Gwynn Guilford on what would happen if Donald Trump became the US president. </strong>“In a word, chaos. In two, expensive chaos… But here’s the surprise: While most of his proposals are sheer lunacy, some of his economic proposals are grounded in a surprisingly well-developed worldview—one that could arguably help American workers, though not without enormous disruption.” <a href="http://qz.com/607532/this-is-what-a-donald-trump-presidency-would-actually-look-like/">Read more here</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Matters of debate</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A basic pillar of finance is crumbling.</strong> <a href="http://qz.com/613302/the-simple-rule-at-the-heart-of-finance-is-being-broken/">Negative interest rates</a> have turned financial logic upside-down.</p>
<p><strong>The world’s richest countries are a ticking demographic time bomb.</strong> The year 2040 is <a href="http://qz.com/588072/the-demographic-problem-you-really-need-to-worry-about/">not looking good</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Surprising discoveries</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Egypt&#8217;s presidential motorcade drove along a two-mile (3.2 km) red carpet.</strong> It was <a href="http://qz.com/614086/egypts-president-rolled-out-a-two-mile-red-carpet-to-open-homes-for-the-poor/">visiting some of Cairo&#8217;s poorest people</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A Slovenian town is going ahead with Europe&#8217;s first beer fountain.</strong> Never wait <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35533639">at the bar again</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado now has a billion-dollar marijuana industry.</strong> It&#8217;s earned the state <a href="http://qz.com/613879/legal-marijuana-is-now-a-billion-dollar-industry-in-colorado/">more than $135 million in taxes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More twins are being born in developed countries.</strong> An increase in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/why-mothers-in-rich-countries-are-having-more-twins/462069/">older women giving birth</a> is the likely cause.</p>
<p><strong>China is reshaping soccer. </strong>Taking advantage of Brazil’s economic downturn, Chinese clubs have been signing some of <a href="http://fusion.net/story/265653/how-the-chinese-super-league-reshaping-brazilian-soccer/">the country’s top players</a>.</p>

For $10 per night, you can sleep in a cozy wood-framed bedroom and imagine that you too are a mentally fragile genius with a troubled relationship to Paul Gauguin.</p>

<p>The room was built in advance of a major <a href="http://www.vogue.com/13396409/van-gogh-bedrooms-art-institute-chicago/">exhibit of Van Gogh&#8217;s work</a> at the Art Institute of Chicago that opens this month. The show will unite Van Gogh’s three paintings of the bedroom where he lived from 1888 to 1889.</p>
<p>“This room will make you feel like you&#8217;re living in a painting,” reads <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10981658?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=02-09&amp;utm_campaign=vangoghbnb">the Airbnb listing</a>, posted by host “Vincent.” According to the ad, the room comes with Internet and a TV.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/sbi.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="India-SBI-chairman" /><p>India&#8217;s largest lender by assets, the State Bank of India (SBI), just got hammered by bad loans.</p>
<p>The state-owned bank&#8217;s profit for the third quarter of the 2016 fiscal (October-December) fell 62% compared to a year ago, according to its <a href="http://corporates.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/03D919BB_AB02_4F6A_A767_061811FEEA25_131209.pdf" target="_blank">earnings report</a> (pdf) released on Feb. 11.</p>
<p>Non-performing assets (NPAs) are the main culprit.</p>
<p>The NPA provisions for the quarter shot up 59% compared to a year ago, while the gross NPA ratio inched upwards to 5.1% from 4.15% in the previous quarter. The NPA ratio is an indicator of the bank&#8217;s overall health—a higher ratio means more bad loans. Banks make provisions—set funds aside—typically to cover for default risks.</p>
<p>According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), an NPA is a loan where interest or principal has not been paid for more than 90 days.</p>
<p>SBI&#8217;s earnings are further evidence of bad loans plaguing the banking sector in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. The bank made a profit of Rs1,115.34 crore in the quarter, compared to Rs2,910.06 crore in the same period of the last fiscal. Analysts <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-11/state-bank-of-india-profit-misses-estimates-as-bad-loans-surge" target="_blank">surveyed by Bloomberg</a> had estimated a Rs3,300 crore net profit.</p>
<p>SBI&#8217;s stock fell as much as 1.57% on the BSE, after the results were announced.</p>
<p>Everyone, from analysts to RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, has warned of these toxic bad loans. Public sector banks (PSBs) held gross NPAs <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/banking-finance/private-banks-profits-outpace-psbs-in-q1/119096/" target="_blank">worth almost Rs3 lakh crore</a> ($44 billion) as of June 2015—89% of the total NPAs in the entire banking system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Indian Express newspaper on Feb. 09 reported that state-owned banks have <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/" target="_blank">written off bad loans </a>worth Rs1.14 lakh crore between 2013 and 2015 fiscal years, and 40% of these loans were waived by SBI.</p>
<p>Rajan has set a March 2017 deadline for banks to set up provisions to cover these bad loans.</p>
<p>Other PSBs too reported dismal earnings this week. For instance, Punjab National Bank said on Feb. 09 that profit for the third quarter <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/pnb-net-profit-slumps-93-in-december-quarter-116020900415_1.html" target="_blank">had dropped 93%</a>, owing to higher NPAs, especially in the steel, power and infrastructure sectors. Other banks such as the Central Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, and Dena Bank <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Companies/rcR6Hm4e0J14StJLsUzpDI/PSU-bank-profits-plunge-as-loan-cleanup-begins.html" target="_blank">reported losses</a>.</p>
<p>In January, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, had said that the extra provisioning ordered by the RBI might not hit the bank as hard. &#8220;I have no idea as to where and why these concerns are coming. I would suggest that you should have a little patience to see how things pan out,&#8221; <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/sbi-downplays-provisons-pressure-concerns-116011600035_1.html" target="_blank">she said.</a></p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s quarterly numbers may have come as a rude shock to Bhattacharya.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=614971&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rtx1sd5s.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="Up in the air." /><p>China is heading for further financial chaos. In the near future the yuan could lose a third of its value against the dollar, the government would need to print more than $10 trillion to keep banks liquid, and financial institutions are set lose trillions of dollars in equity value.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to a forecast by Kyle Bass, a US hedge fund manager who predicted the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. In the end, he&#8217;s betting, China&#8217;s banking system will suffer a loss four times greater than that suffered by US banks during the great recession.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are witnessing is the resetting of the largest macro imbalance the world has ever seen,&#8221; Bass wrote in a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-10/bass-says-china-s-banking-losses-may-top-400-of-subprime-crisis">note to clients, seen by Bloomberg</a>. &#8220;The problems China faces have no precedent&#8230; They are so large that it will take every ounce of commitment by the Chinese government to rectify the imbalances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bass, who founded and runs Dallas-based Hayman Capital Management, said that the risk to China comes from its banking system, which he says has used off-balance-sheet lending to grow its assets to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/kyle-bass-hedge-fund-estimates-chinas-foreign-reserves-below-critical-level-1455128104">more than three times the size</a> (paywall) of the country&#8217;s GDP.</p>
<p>The expected number of non-performing loans—that is, loans that borrowers are not expected to be able to pay back—is so high that Bass anticipates $3.5 trillion being wiped from banks&#8217; balance sheets. The government may then be required to print as much as $10 trillion to keep those banks liquid.</p>
<h2>Foreign currency shortfall</h2>
<p>In the letter, the hedge fund manager also outlined his opinion that China&#8217;s foreign currency reserves are much smaller than they appear. That&#8217;s because much of the $3.2 trillion China has in foreign currencies is tied up in other products or has been lent out, meaning it is not immediately retrievable. Ultimately, only around $2.2 trillion of that figure is on hand to the central bank, Bass wrote.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="4JfYf7rqx" data-width="640" data-height="409"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_4JfYf7rqx.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>That matters a great deal because the central bank has been spending its foreign currency reserves at a pace of <a href="http://qz.com/613843/more-than-110-billion-left-china-last-month-and-that-was-an-improvement/">around $100 billion per month</a> lately. It&#8217;s doing this largely to <a href="http://qz.com/596745/beijing-controls-the-largest-most-powerful-propaganda-team-on-the-planet-so-why-is-chinas-pr-suddenly-so-awful/">prop up the value of the yuan</a>. Should the value fall, businesses are expected to export their cash out of China, in turn devaluing the yuan further and supporting a vicious free-fall.</p>
<p>Even with a war chest of $3.2 trillion, that kind of spending couldn&#8217;t last forever. But with about a third of it tied up and out of reach, Bass suggests, the point at which the central bank can no longer support the economy the way is has been will arrive much sooner.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=614921&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rtx1ut39.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="India-US-United States-China-Modi-Obama-Naval patrol-South China Sea" /><p>The already hot waters of the South China Sea seem to be heading for boiling point.</p>
<p>The US and India have held talks to conduct joint naval patrols in the Indian Ocean and in the South China Sea by the end of the year, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-india-usa-idUSKCN0VJ0AA">Reuters reported.</a> Joint naval patrols involve two countries working together to secure maritime interests, a manoeuvre that the Indian Navy has so far never undertaken.</p>
<p>A strategically <a href="http://www.coi.gov.cn/scs/introduction/ziyuan.htm">vital and reportedly oil rich</a> 3,500,000-square-kilometre body of water, the South China Sea is ensconced between the Asian mainland and a whole host of east Asian island nations. And almost every country touched by it—China, The Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei, and Malaysia, among others—claim some right or the other over it, or at least over some part of it.</p>
<p>China, of course, is the most assertive. The dominant military and economic power in the region, Beijing has been building man-made islands to use as bases for supporting air and sea patrols. The idea is also perceived to be <a href="http://qz.com/401682/the-world-is-wary-of-chinas-great-wall-of-sand-in-the-sea/">part of its strategy to legitimise</a> its claims over the region in the long run.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s apparent decision to partner Washington in patrolling the region comes a year after US president Barack Obama and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi agreed to &#8220;identify specific areas for expanding maritime cooperation&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/25/us-india-joint-strategic-vision-asia-pacific-and-indian-ocean-region">ensuring freedom of navigation</a>&#8221; in the South China Sea. When they met in New Delhi in January 2015, the two leaders had <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/30/us-india-joint-statement">expressed concerns about</a> &#8220;rising tensions over maritime territorial disputes&#8221; in the region.</p>
<p>An emailed questionnaire to India&#8217;s foreign ministry by Quartz remained unanswered while an Indian Navy spokesperson said he wasn&#8217;t aware of any decision on the joint patrolling. A Pentagon spokesperson, <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/no-decision-on-joint-naval-patrol-with-india-in-scs-pentagon/articleshow/50937157.cms">meanwhile, said that</a> &#8220;on the matter of joint patrols, no decisions have been made and we do not have any additional details to provide at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kanwal Sibal, a former Indian foreign secretary, expressed skepticism at possibility of the joint patrols.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, India has not faced any problem with its vessel movement in the region and unless there is provocation, there is no need for India to undertake a joint patrol,&#8221; Sibal told Quartz. &#8220;The implications of such an act can be big.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other analysts, however, viewed the possible move as more aggressive posturing by New Delhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think India has become more candid about its foreign policy now,&#8221; Sameer Patil, a fellow at Mumbai-based think tank, Gateway House, told Quartz. &#8220;For instance, India had never put its bilateral concerns on paper, which it did when the US president visited India last year. This recent decision is sending a strong message to China.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This will signal to the Chinese that they cannot undermine us (India) and expect us not to react,&#8221; Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank, Observer Research Foundation, told Quartz.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a signal for a realignment of the Indian foreign policy. Till now, India said it was unaligned, it remains so today. But it has distinctly come closer to the US and Japan. This is also a signal that India does not expect too much from China, either in the settlement of the border dispute or from investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has spent much time and effort on foreign policy. Closer home, his trips to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, have been largely aimed at rebuilding India&#8217;s influence in the region. Modi has also actively engaged with China, hosting president Xi Jinping in September 2014 before making a trip to Beijing in May 2015.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=613887&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/rtr3302s.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="Lots of leg at Virgin Atlantic." /><p>In the face of tightening security measures and budget cuts, airlines have tried to maintain a sense of <a href="http://www.racked.com/2013/11/13/7638041/post-17#4468090">old-world glamour</a> by requiring their employees to follow strict uniform requirements.</p>
<p>These requirements have been particularly restrictive for female cabin crew. Female flight attendants at Virgin Atlantic Airways must submit a personal request for permission to wear trousers as part of their <a href="https://blog.virgin-atlantic.com/t5/Our-Style/Sky-High-Fashion-First-Look-at-Vivienne-Westwood-Designed/ba-p/8896#.VrpSgZMrJmA">high-fashion designer uniforms</a>, while European budget airline Ryanair and Saudi Arabian luxury airline Etihad both ban female flight attendants from wearing trousers on duty, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/Sexism-in-the-sky-how-do-airlines-get-away-with-it/">according to The Telegraph</a>.</p>
<p>At British Airways, female flight attendants who joined the company before 2010<em> </em>have been allowed to wear trousers as part of their uniform for the last 15 years, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/british-airways-cabin-crew-trousers-union">according to The Guardian</a>. But women recruited since 2010 do not have a trouser option as part of their uniform. These flight attendants, hired after a series of employee strikes, have a different uniform, as well as lower salaries, than veteran flight attendants, and could only request trousers on religious or health grounds.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a creative workaround orchestrated by the union representing 2,100 of the 3,000 new employees covered by the more restrictive dress rules, getting that permission will be a lot easier, <a href="http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/british-airways-joins-21st-century-and-drops-trouser-ban-for-female-cabin-crew/">the union</a> says.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We filed a collective grievance with British Airways, which you can do under UK employment law,&#8221; union representative Matt Smith told Quartz. &#8220;They batted that back, so we then </span><span class="s1">put in a request on behalf of one of our female members. We told them we were running that as a legal test case, and, before we submitted another grievance, it was granted.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The labor group, called Unite, used the letter submitted by the union member to create a template for other crew members to use in requesting permission to wear trousers. </span><span class="s1">&#8220;Every woman who has gone through has been granted trousers,&#8221; Smith says. </span></p>
<p>The no-trousers rule was first raised by Unite on behalf of female employees <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/british-airways-cabin-crew-trousers-union">two years ago</a>. Unite polled its members and found that more than 80% of female employees represented by the union who did not have the option to wear trousers wanted the rule changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A<span class="s1"> lot of our members have been waiting for this. T</span><span class="s1">hankfully British Airways decided to do the right thing</span>,&#8221; Smith says.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Putting aside whether or not women&#8217;s legs should be a selling point for modern airlines, </span>forcing female flight attendants to wear skirts has some potentially serious safety implications. In the case of a fire, nylon pantyhose can melt, producing serious burns, while trousers made from natural fibers—like British Airways&#8217; 80% wool, 20% <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/british-airways-cabin-crew-trousers-union">polyester blend trousers</a>—provide protection.</p>
<p>And for flight attendants flying to South America, increased leg coverage can provide better protection from Zika virus-carrying mosquitos, Unite <a href="http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/british-airways-joins-21st-century-and-drops-trouser-ban-for-female-cabin-crew/">pointed out</a>. Given this consideration, British Airways&#8217; concession has come at an especially good time.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=613337&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

International visitors become easily lost or disoriented in what&#8217;s been ranked the <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/busiest-station">world&#8217;s busiest station</a>, with about 3.6 million daily passengers.</p>

<p>Help is at hand, however. This week East Japan Railway <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2016/02/10/tokyos-jr-shinjuku-station-to-get-its-own-navigation-app/">unveiled a smartphone app</a> specifically for navigating Shinjuku station, available in English and Japanese. The company, which has a large presence at the station, aims to have a final version ready by next spring, well ahead of Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Using Wi-Fi and other tracking systems, <a href="http://www.jreast-app.jp/s-navi/">the app</a>—currently in beta—determines where a passenger is, including on which floor, and then offers the best route to the destination (at least the destination within the train station). Anyone who&#8217;s been dazed and confused in Shinjuku station knows what a godsend this could be. One of the transit hub’s many confusing aspects is that it hosts not just East Japan Railway ​(which alone served 478,000 passengers per day at the station in 2014), but a handful of other railway operators, too—all using their own systems and signage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another example of the confusion that international tourists can face in Japan. Prime minister Shinzo Abe wants to <a href="http://www.japantoday.com/category/politics/view/abe-eyes-new-action-plan-to-boost-tourism-to-japan">make tourism a key engine</a> driving economic growth. The nation has indeed enjoyed considerable success in luring more visitors in recent years.</p>
<div class="atlas-chart" data-id="NJvfkY79x" data-width="640" data-height="409"><img src="https://atlas.qz.com/i/atlas_NJvfkY79x.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
<p>But it still has plenty of work ahead in terms of helping visitors after they&#8217;ve arrived. Most of Japan’s cash machines are <a href="http://qz.com/411905/because-of-galapagos-syndrome-most-of-japans-cash-machines-are-useless-to-foreigners/">useless to foreigners</a>, for example, because they evolved in relative isolation from the rest of the world. Tokyo is also short on regular hotel rooms, which has forced some visitors to stay in corporate offices <a href="http://qz.com/489246/tokyo-is-running-out-of-regular-hotel-rooms-why-not-stay-in-a-converted-corporate-office-instead/">converted into hostels</a> instead. (Japan is trying to shoo visitors away from congested Tokyo and other hotspots and into the nation&#8217;s <a href="http://qz.com/613623/swarms-of-chinese-tourists-make-it-tough-for-the-japanese-to-vacation-at-home/">less crowded destinations</a>, such as the bucolic Shizuoka prefecture.)</p>
<p>Of course, a navigational app for Shinjuku station probably should have been offered years ago. But for anyone who&#8217;s been lost and bewildered in the transit hub&#8217;s frenetic corridors, its debut no doubt will be a step in the right direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/h_01959794.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="India-Pakistan-Headley" /><p>The deposition by David Headley, the Lashkar-e-Taiba operative, has not been earth-shaking in its content. We already knew almost everything he said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was important to hear things from the horse&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>Having said that, Headley also puts the Narendra Modi government in a serious dilemma.</p>
<p>What do we do now with what Headley has told us? That is the core issue. How exactly are we to follow up on his deposition?</p>
<p>The bureaucratic option is always there—share the contents of Headley&#8217;s deposition with the Pakistani authorities through diplomatic channels and seek follow-up action in good faith.</p>
<p>But it will be a cynical thing to do to rest oars thereafter since we can be 100% certain that Pakistan will do nothing in the matter and will continue to parry.</p>
<p>Pakistan cannot and will not cooperate with India. It cannot cooperate with us because its culpability is crystal clear and those responsible for the 26/11 terrorist strikes in Mumbai included senior Pakistani military officers.</p>
<p>The Pakistani top brass&#8217;s involvement in terrorism implies that any action on the Indian demarche by their government will bring the roof crashing down on the Inter-Services Intelligence, better known as ISI, and irreparably damage the reputation of their army as an institution.</p>
<p>It is too much to expect any Pakistani government—or any country for that matter—to indulge in such brutal soul-searching. Those who advocate atonement by Pakistan are either ignorant of statecraft or are simply dissimulating.</p>
<p>What else can India do? Indeed, a blistering international campaign can be launched with India&#8217;s able diplomats firing all six cylinders to expose the grotesque face of Pakistan to the world community.</p>
<p>Foreign secretary S Jaishankar <a href="http://scroll.in/article/802942/full-text-name-and-shame-the-states-behind-non-state-actors-says-foreign-secretary-jaishankar" target="_blank">promised recently</a> to put Pakistan to &#8220;shame&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fine. But, where does that take us? For one thing, Pakistan&#8217;s reputation is already in the mud but it has been chugging along, nonetheless. Some more mud isn&#8217;t going to make any difference.</p>
<p>Besides, it is sheer naivete to believe we can put Pakistan to &#8220;shame.&#8221; The international community is not willing to join hands with us on such a track.</p>
<p>Second, to every fistful of mud we throw at Pakistan, one can be certain that Islamabad will return with an equal fist. And if past experience is anything to go by, Pakistan has a way of getting the better of us in a slugfest.</p>
<h2>Two options</h2>
<p>The real dilemma lies on two other counts. One, how do we handle the relations with Pakistan in the aftermath of Headley&#8217;s disclosures?</p>
<p>True, he didn&#8217;t add much to what we already knew. But he did bring the 26/11 attack back into focus.</p>
<p>The memory was getting jaded in our collective consciousness, which is overcrowded since 2008 with scams, beef-eating, air pollution, gang rapes, et al. But the jaded memory got burnished in the past 48 hours. The pain has returned.</p>
<p>For the government, which also happens to be rooted in nationalist sentiments, it becomes difficult to be seen constructively engaging Pakistan when that country&#8217;s enemy image is such a widely shared public perception.</p>
<p>Simply put, it is even difficult to defend Modi&#8217;s overtures to Pakistan as &#8220;statesmanlike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equally, the foreign secretary&#8217;s expected trip to Islamabad for talks will not make sense to the Indian public—in a near future, at least. The government might as well roll down the shutter and close shop as if Pakistan never existed. This is one option.</p>
<p>The other option will be to punish Pakistan in the same coin. The present government unabashedly admires Israel. Ask Israel how best we can punish Pakistan.</p>
<p>Political assassination is a favourite weapon in the Israeli armoury. Commando raid is another. Outright invasion is yet another.</p>
<p>Choose the method best suited to our needs and circumstances. And hit Pakistan hard—so hard that they cry for mercy. This is the second <span style="line-height:1.5;">option.</span></p>
<p>Both these options are widely recommended by our pundits as mutually reinforcing ones, too. But then, there is a catch in all this.</p>
<p>Ignoring Pakistan is actually a non-option, if only because we simply cannot choose our neighbours. And in this case, there isn&#8217;t any certainty that Pakistan is in any mood to &#8220;ignore&#8221; us. It will probably keep reminding us every now and then that it does remember us.</p>
<p>Again, even assuming we share the Israeli DNA, Pakistan is not Palestine. While Israel can use Gaza and West Bank as punch bags, if we punch Pakistan, make no mistake, it will punch back.</p>
<p>There is a moral in the story, after all, why Israel ceased to attack Lebanon once it transpired that Hezbollah has a stockpile of 40,000 rockets to retaliate. That is the story of all &#8220;asymmetric&#8221; wars.</p>
<p>Besides, do we really want to get entangled in a futile war of attrition with Pakistan and make it our way of life?</p>
<p>India has so much going for it by way of manifest destiny as an emerging power if only it could sustain a high momentum of growth—for which, of course, a peaceful immediate external environment is a crucial prerequisite. War and conflicts will be a drain on resources.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic embarrassment</h2>
<p>All in all, therefore, Headley&#8217;s deposition poses a diplomatic embarrassment. He is an American citizen. What he divulged would already have been known to the US authorities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the US has lately intensified its collaboration with Pakistan by forming an exclusive Quadrilateral Consultative Group to try and negotiate a settlement with the Taliban.</p>
<p>What emerges is that the US has specific interests to pursue in the region, which demands that Pakistan be <span style="line-height:1.5;">cultivated as a key non-NATO regional ally.</span></p>
<p>The Obama administration continues to do business with the Pakistani military and the ISI despite their dalliance with Osama bin Laden who was responsible for the death of 2,996 people in America.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, the only option open to India too will be to remain engaged with Pakistan, to lower the tensions in the relationship and work toward eliminating the root causes behind <span style="line-height:1.5;">this &#8220;asymmetric&#8221; war.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/fb.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="India-Free-Basics" /><p>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has given Facebook’s Free Basics (a cutely rebranded Internet.org) <a href="http://qz.com/612082/sorry-facebook-india-has-decided-to-remain-a-land-of-free-and-open-internet/" target="_blank">a big thumbs-down</a>. The opposition from many quarters led to the decision by Indian regulator.</p>
<p>“This can prove to be risky in the medium to long term as the knowledge and outlook of those users would be shaped only by the information made available through those select offerings,” the agency wrote. On Feb. 08, in a report, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/business/facebook-loses-a-battle-in-india-over-its-free-basics-program.html?ref=technology" target="_blank">The New York Times wrote</a>, “Facebook spent millions of dollars on advertising to promote its position and ran special banners in the news feeds of Indian users urging them to petition the government to allow Free Basics.” It is a setback for co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company, which has been working hard to win over India.</p>
<p>Much of the opposition to Facebook’s Internet.org/Free Basics has been framed around the net neutrality debate. But, to me, the problem is rooted in the <a href="http://om.co/2013/03/17/uber-data-darwinism-and-the-future-of-work/" target="_blank">idea of Data Darwinism</a>, where data owners shape the narrative and make decisions that leave millions without a choice.</p>
<p>My opposition to Internet.org is not recent: Ever since it was announced, I have denounced its duplicitous name. Facebook still calls its efforts Internet.org across most of the world and paints it as a not-for-profit effort. I disagree with two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet.org isn’t about the internet, so Facebook should stop calling it as such and call it what it is: Facebook Free (with strings attached). To call it Internet.org is actually the first sin of this whole debacle.</li>
<li>Facebook Free Basics isn’t a charity. It is a way for Facebook to gather more attention and sell services and advertising to those who get Facebook’s Free Basics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe I’m suspicious because my family has told me their personal story of the British Raj or maybe because I have read books that over and again detail how a commercial spearhead (<a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/East-India-Company" target="_blank">The East India Company</a>) came bearing gifts and made way for British imperialism. Regardless, I am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts. Nothing—and I do mean nothing—in this life is free. You always pay a price.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell whether money or politics come first, but either way, they are intertwined. During industrialisation, the two key commodities for economic growth were labour and actual commodities. The British Empire became dominant because it mastered mass production and consumption as well as controlling commodities. And it started with The East India Company. The subjugation of the Indian subcontinent was part of industrialisation. In the 20th century, petroleum shaped the political narrative; in this new century, “attention” shapes politics. That is why we have to look at this issue of Internet.org from a cultural standpoint.</p>
<p>In our post-internet age, labour and commodities have been replaced by attention and connectivity. By controlling these, Facebook in many ways has its algorithm decide what is important in the future. I am positive that its role as a gatekeeper of information will cause much deeper problems in the long term.</p>
<p>In a more diabolical scenario, it isn’t hard to imagine Facebook helping sway the outcome of elections. In the US, election-spending and Facebook are a potent mix, as we are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/28/facebook-voters-us-election-ted-cruz-targeted-ads-trump" target="_blank">made aware every day</a>. In emerging economies, where money has an outsized influence on election results, can Facebook stand up and say no to dollars? Can it say no to money—anyone’s money, for that matter—if its overall growth starts to stall?</p>
<p>Zuckerberg or other senior executives have never discussed with me the responsibility and transparency of their algorithms from a social and cultural standpoint. What are the things he and Facebook won’t do? Will they open up access to everyone, including rivals, to offer services on their platform, and will they offer an equal, bidirectional exchange of data to one and all under the mandates of open source? Can they promise that they won’t use the information for targeting and advertising purposes?</p>
<p>Up until then, from my perspective, Free Basics/Internet.org is all about advertising and making money. Today and tomorrow, Facebook will take decisions based on how it makes or will make money. That is what for-profit corporations do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="364" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/startups.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="india-startups-banks-sbi" /><p>After years of thriving on private investments, the Indian startup ecosystem—one of the fastest growing in the world—has finally caught the attention of commercial banks.</p>
<p>This year, both public and private banks have announced several measures to help startups—from helping them set up companies to even branding and marketing. However, there is one key initiative that is missing: financing.</p>
<h2>What are banks doing?</h2>
<p>On Jan. 14, the State Bank of India (SBI), the country&#8217;s largest lender, <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/sbi-opens-first-dedicated-banking-branch-for-startups-116011400431_1.html" target="_blank">opened a dedicated branch</a> in Bengaluru for startups. &#8220;We had been thinking of starting a dedicated branch for quite some time. Startups have a different kind of requirement. These are young entrepreneurs in their early 20s and 30s and many don&#8217;t even have bank accounts,&#8221; Rajni Mishra, chief general manager of SBI, Bengaluru circle, told Quartz.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need a lot of advice in terms of compliance, remittances, and foreign exchange, among others. So we thought we need to take them out of the normal branches,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The SBI branch, called InCube, will help startups register their companies, manage financial accounts for employees and do paperwork when raising funds from foreign investors.</p>
<p>Mishra said InCube is different from their other offices—the employees are young, and the ambience is more &#8220;coffee-shop-like.&#8221; The government-owned lender wants to open similar branches in Mumbai and Delhi too.</p>
<p>In January, RBL Bank, a private lender based in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, also launched an initiative called <a href="http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/this-bank-launched-unique-banking-platform-for-startups/story/228441.html" target="_blank">India Startup Club</a>. This will help startups find chartered accountants, offices, and co-working spaces. It will also help with social media marketing, branding, and customer relationship management. DCB Bank, a private lender, has tied up with institutions such as the Birla Institute of Technology &amp; Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, to launch entrepreneurship programmes.</p>
<p>This is not a &#8220;sudden interest,&#8221; said Rana Vikram Anand, who heads segments and products, business and branch banking, at RBL Bank. The bank had been watching this space for several months, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Normally, when you want to do something for a customer, you look for a reasonable number that is available. Otherwise, it just doesn&#8217;t work out because you don&#8217;t really get down to an individual customer and create products and offerings for them,&#8221; Anand said.</p>
<h2>Everything but money</h2>
<p>Right now, it&#8217;s not easy for an entrepreneur to get a bank loan. Typically, a loan needs a collateral, and for a young entrepreneur that is a big problem. Even under the current <a href="http://yourstory.com/2013/01/collateral-free-loan-scheme-from-psus/" target="_blank">collateral-free loan scheme</a> for startups, only companies funded by venture capitalists (VCs) or angel investors can apply.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Shankar Prasad, a former top executive of Bharti Airtel and Tata Communications, wanted to set up a startup in 2013, he was clear that he wanted to build a certain scale before going for VC funding. So he approached several banks for loans, but was unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually, Prasad used his personal assets and savings as collateral to get a loan for his startup, Snaxsmart, which installs and maintains health-food vending machines at hospitals and offices. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I had a collateral to offer because I had worked for years before I did my startup. Young entrepreneurs, most of who are right out of college, won&#8217;t be able to do that,&#8221; Prasad told Quartz. &#8220;So, the only choice they are left with is to raise funds through equity, which is very costly. They will be forced to dilute their stake at a low valuation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1">But banks say there is no pressing need for them to extend loans since a lot of VC money is now available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lending by banks will continue to depend on the &#8220;solidity of the model,&#8221; Praveen Kutty, head of retail and SME banking, DCB Bank, told Quartz. He said profits for most startups are very thin, and for a financier, cashflows are very important. </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;And that I don&#8217;t see changing too much,&#8221; Kutty said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com&#038;blog=39587363&#038;post=611919&#038;subd=qzprod&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="640" height="360" src="https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/musk-car.jpeg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640" class="attachment-medium_10 size-medium_10 wp-post-image" alt="The best car ever made, apart from the other car he made." /><p>On a call with analysts today following the release of its <a href="http://qz.com/614608/tesla-expects-to-be-profitable-by-the-end-of-2016-and-wall-street-is-psyched/">fourth quarter earnings</a>, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was asked about the rollout of the company&#8217;s most recent vehicle, the crossover Model X. He said, in hindsight, the company probably should&#8217;ve tried to do less with the first iteration of the vehicle, but he had some grand statements to make about Tesla&#8217;s first two electric cars, which were somewhat contradictory.</p>
<p>After answering the rollout question, Musk went on a tangent with his thoughts on the car:</p>
<blockquote><p>Honestly think it&#8217;s probably the best car ever. I&#8217;m not sure anyone is going to make a car like this again. I&#8217;m not sure Tesla would make a car like this again. I mean, I&#8217;d be surprised if somebody buys the X and, particularly if the software is refined, if it&#8217;s not the product they love more than any product they&#8217;ve ever bought.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tesla said <a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/1441162152x0x874449/945B9CF5-86DA-4C35-B03C-4892824F058D/Q4_15_Tesla_Update_Letter.pdf">in a release</a> that it only delivered 206 Model Xs in the last quarter, the first full quarter it was on sale.</p>
<p>Later in the call, when asked to clarify whether the Model X was better than the Model S, Musk had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a question of owner preference. I mean, I personally still prefer to drive the Model S over the X, because I like the lower position of a sedan. And the S, in terms of performance, is about 10% better in an acceleration through handling and whatnot than the X.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which makes it sounds like Musk actually prefers to drive the Model S, even though he thinks the Model X is the best car ever. To make things even less clear, he followed up with these thoughts:</p>
<blockquote><p>So it really depends on owner optimization. &#8230; One of the best features, maybe the best feature of the X, is the cockpit style front windshield, which gives you this amazing panoramic view as you drive. So a lot of people are like that in an SUV, and that&#8217;s the reason they buy that. It really depends on personal preference, and we&#8217;ll see what results are once we actually put the vehicle in stores and people take test drives.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the X is the best if you like the height on the road that SUVs give you, otherwise the S is the best, if you like that better.</p>
<p>And all of that says nothing for the company&#8217;s <a href="http://qz.com/540783/elon-musk-is-looking-to-acquire-companies-to-speed-up-production-of-teslas-model-3/">forthcoming Model 3</a>, which Tesla plans to unveil on March 31. Perhaps that will also be the best car ever made, as long as you don&#8217;t prefer driving the Model S, or X.</p>
