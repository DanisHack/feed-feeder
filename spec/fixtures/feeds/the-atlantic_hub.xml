    <content xml:base="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/02/obama-springfield-illinois/462297/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Russell &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/obamas-frustrating-return-to-the-politics-of-hope/462252/"&gt;has a great story&lt;/a&gt; today on President Obama’s return to the Illinois capital, where he announced his candidacy for the White House exactly nine years ago. Speaking to the state legislature, Obama, his hair much grayer now, lamented his failure to close “the yawning gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics.” Watch the full speech here:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="321" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ziTQoGXh1Qc" width="570"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The smallness of our politics” appeared in Obama’s 2007 speech, too. Back then, Obama sounded, unsurprisingly, a lot more more hopeful about remedying that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="321" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdJ7Ad15WCA" width="570"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then-Senator Obama said it was in Springfield that “we learned to&lt;span&gt; disagree without being disagreeable—that it’s possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we’re willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Washington? That, he would learn, is a whole ’nother ballgame. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The complaint &lt;a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-bring-constitutional-policing-ferguson-missouri"&gt;alleges&lt;/a&gt; that Ferguson police routinely violated federal civil-rights laws by, among other things, conducting stops and arrests without legal justification, using excessive force, and discriminating against black residents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The race to understand Zika: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;European researchers say they have discovered an abnormal brain in a fetus whose mother experienced symptoms of the mosquito-borne virus at the end of her first trimester while she was living in Brazil, the AP &lt;a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/deb3e8047e2d43008d00d1e5de789d02/study-finds-zika-virus-fetal-brain-clue-outbreak"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;After a weak showing in the New Hampshire primary, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina dropped out of the presidential race. The U.S. Department of Justice will be taking legal action against the city of Ferguson, Missouri. Bernie Sanders rode a wave of momentum following his win in the state, raising more than $5 million. President Obama spoke in Springfield, Illinois about the partisan political divide in Congress. On the Hill, Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. economy might see slower growth in the upcoming year. And South Korea is suspended operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;There was a moment in the middle of President Obama’s address to the Illinois state legislature on Wednesday when a look of fear briefly came over his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to lawmakers with whom he used to serve, the president had been waxing nostalgic about his time as a state senator. Legislating in Springfield, as Obama described it, was nothing like the polarized Washington swamp. Sure, there was plenty of disagreement in Illinois, and the two parties debated the issues vigorously. But the political fights were civil. Republicans and Democrats played poker with each other, enjoyed rounds of golf together. They socialized. They didn’t call each other “idiots” or “fascists,” he said, “because then we would have to explain why we were playing poker with an idiot or a fascist who was trying to destroy America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the White House, Obama’s inability to change politics has become his greatest failure and, as he has conceded repeatedly, “one of my biggest regrets.” He had not, he told some of his former colleagues in Springfield, been able to close “the yawning gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="primary-categorization"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everything was different in Illinois—or at least that’s how the president had remembered it when he left over a decade ago. Because as Obama was claiming credit for what he had accomplished in spite of all the partisan rancor, he saw that only the Democrats in the Illinois general assembly chamber were standing to applaud. The legislature was cleaving along party lines before his eyes, just like Congress does every year when he speaks in the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first Obama smirked. “See, I didn’t want this to be a State of the Union speech where we have the standing up and the sitting down,” he interjected, drawing chuckles from the lawmakers. “C’mon guys, you know better than that,” he joked, pointing at his Democratic friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then instead of quieting down, the applause from Democrats grew louder, and cheers erupted. Now Obama was annoyed, and he looked momentarily afraid that he was losing control of the crowd. He put his hands up. “I’ve got a serious point to make here,” the president said. “I’ve got a serious point to make here, because this is part of the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members in the Illinois legislature were proving Obama’s point, and not in the way he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was intended as a grand homecoming for the president, coinciding with the ninth anniversary of the speech that launched his campaign for the White House. Joined by his close friends Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, and Senator Dick Durbin, Obama’s speech to the lawmakers and then a second one to supporters was part of a yearlong farewell tour of sorts that began with his State of the Union address. In returning to Springfield, the president was also returning to the place that had inspired his “politics of hope” message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He began his speech with inside jokes and friendly call-outs to members of both parties before turning to his assessment of politics in America. The address lasted over an hour, but by the end Obama had mostly said a lot of things he’s said in interviews, speeches, and press conferences throughout his tenure. He called for reducing “the corrosive influence of money in politics”; an end to gerrymandered congressional districts; same-day and automatic voter registration laws that make it easier, not harder, for citizens to cast ballots; and a greater commitment to civility in politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama made only passing references to the presidential race, but it was hardly a coincidence that his call for civility came a day after the candidate of incivility, Donald Trump, had won a landslide victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary. “We can’t move forward if all we do is tear each other down,” he said. “We should insist on a higher form of discourse in our political life.” There were also lines that could have resonance in the Democratic race, as when Obama made a pitch for pragmatism and criticized groups in both parties who condemned compromise and demanded purity from their allies. (In a possible dig at Bernie Sanders, he knocked not only “union bashing” but also “corporate bashing.”) “That kind of politics means that the supporters will be perennially disappointed,” the president said. “It only adds to folks’ sense that the system is rigged. It’s one of the reasons why we see these big electoral swings every few years. It’s why people are so cynical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obama&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s remarks drew kudos from government-reform advocates but a much harsher response from Republicans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“President Obama is uniquely unqualified to deliver this message and the Illinois legislature is uniquely unqualified to play host to a speech on bipartisanship,” complained Representative Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican in Congress who served alongside Obama in the state Senate. “&lt;/span&gt;One thing in particular I’ve noticed about the president is his utter incapacity to be reflective about the weaknesses of his worldview.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the most interesting dynamic in Obama’s speech was his continued frustration that the politicians he was addressing—these friends he was holding up as exemplars!—kept acting like politicians. He chastised the Republicans for cheering his call for gerrymandering reform in a state whose districts have been drawn by Democrats. And he tried in vain to stop Democrats from acting as his partisan cheerleaders. “Sit down, Democrats!” he snapped playfully at one point, sounding like a teacher scolding students he had riled up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all a little too symbolic at points, a president’s futile effort to keep a bunch of rowdy legislators in line. “One thing I’ve learned is that folks don’t change!” Obama ad-libbed when the lawmakers wouldn’t quiet down. In the moment, he was speaking of his former colleagues in Illinois, but it’s a sentiment the frustrated president could easily apply far more broadly than that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content xml:base="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/02/against-endorsements/462261/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I went on &lt;a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/2/10/ta_nehisi_coates_is_voting_for"&gt;Democracy Now&lt;/a&gt; to discuss my critique of “class-first” policy as a way of ameliorating the effects of racism. In the midst of that discussion I made the point that one can maintain a critique of a candidate—in this case Bernie Sanders—and still feel that that candidate is deserving of your vote. Amy Goodman, being an excellent journalist, did exactly what she should have done—she asked if I were going to vote for Senator Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, with some trepidation, answered in the affirmative. I did so because I’ve spent my career trying to get people to answer uncomfortable questions. Indeed, the entire reason I was on the show was to try to push liberals into directly addressing an uncomfortable issue that threatens their coalition. It seemed wrong, somehow, to ask others to step into their uncomfortable space and not do so myself. So I answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer has been characterized, in various places, as an “endorsement,” a characterization that I’d object to. Despite my very obvious political biases, I’ve never felt it was really my job to get people to agree with me. My first duty, as a writer, is to myself. In that sense I simply hope to ask all the questions that keep me up at night. My second duty is to my readers. In that sense, I hope to make readers understand why those questions are critical. I don’t so much hope that any reader “agrees” with me, as I hope to haunt them, to trouble their sense of how things actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really no different with Senator Sanders. The idea that anyone would cast a vote because of how I am casting my vote makes my skin crawl. It misses the point of everything I’ve been trying to do in my time at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. The point is to get people to question, not to recruit them into a religion. Citizens are not sheep. They do not need shepherds, and even if they did I would be poorly qualified. &lt;span&gt;I have thought quite deeply about the problem of racism in American society. I have thought somewhat deeply about inequality and the social safety net. I have though only modestly about foreign policy and the environment. And I haven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;’t thought much at all about net neutrality. I voted for the first time in 2008, following years of skepticism about electoral politics. Whatever. The point is that this is not the record of someone who should be telling other citizens how to vote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what I know, and not much more. And one thing I learned while The Horde was active was to never confuse the perch I enjoy here, one that is as much a matter of chance as anything else, with broad knowledge. So I am no position to offer an “endorsement” to Sanders—one he did not seek, and does not need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to say this not just as a writer, but as a black writer. &lt;span&gt;Too often individuals are appointed to speak for black people. &lt;/span&gt;I don’t want any part of it. Black voters deserve to be addressed in all of their beautiful and wonderful complications, not through the lens of unelected “thought-leaders.” I was asked a question. I tried to answer it honestly. And that’s really all I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;South Korea said it would &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/02/korea-tensions/462120/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;suspend operations at an industrial complex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; it runs jointly with North Korea, in response to a recent rocket launch and nuclear test by Pyongyang. The complex, located in North Korea, houses more than 120 South Korean companies and was established over a decade ago as a symbol of cooperation between the two countries. &lt;/span&gt;The North’s actions have worried its neighbors, among them Japan, which announced new sanctions against Pyongyang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obama’s Climate Plan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/the-supreme-courts-devastating-decision-on-climate/462108/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;temporarily blocked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the implementation of Environmental Protection Agency regulations that would limit greenhouse-gas emissions from the power sector. The rules, issued last summer, are the centerpiece of the White House’s climate-change-fighting agenda, and they play a big part in the recent, tepid optimism about reducing emissions. The order all but guarantees that the legal fight over the plan will outlast the Obama administration itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Race for the White House: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two more Republican candidates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/2016-election/384828/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said goodbye to their presidential aspirations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Both had failed to garner significant support in either Iowa or New Hampshire. Up next for the remaining GOP cast: the South Carolina primary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(AP)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quoted&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The transition from declaring your major to getting a job is &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/a-black-college-student-advising-gap/462078/"&gt;a wasteland&lt;/a&gt;.” —&lt;em&gt;Anthony Carnevale, who studies education and the workforce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Quite a lot of our patients die prematurely. Not because the transplant fails … It’s due to the drugs that I prescribe &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/conditioned-immune-responses/461985/"&gt;every day&lt;/a&gt;.”—&lt;em&gt;Oliver Witzke, a doctor who specializes in kidney disease, on the toxic side effects of immunosuppressants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s a really dangerous business to say, ‘&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/when-computers-started-beating-chess-champions/462216/"&gt;computers will never&lt;/a&gt;,’ and then say something after that.” —&lt;em&gt;Murray Campbell, who developed the first computer to defeat a reigning world chess champion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evening Read&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clare Foran on a new exhibition where &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/laura-poitras-whitney-surveillance/460359/"&gt;mass surveillance is art&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step inside “Astro Noise,” an immersive exhibition by the filmmaker and journalist Laura Poitras, and one of the first things you see is a video showing the distressed faces of men, women, and children. Text appears on screen to indicate that they are staring at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City. The footage vividly captures the emotional toll of terrorism. It’s the starting point for a story of America and the war on terror that Poitras wants to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show, on display at New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art, considers America’s national-security state, delving into drone strikes, interrogation, torture, and surveillance. It’s well-worn ground for Poitras, who’s documented post-9/11 America for years. She’s even become something of a celebrity as a confidant and chronicler of the fugitive whistle-blower Edward Snowden, whom she explored in the Oscar-winning documentary &lt;em&gt;Citizenfour&lt;/em&gt;. “Astro Noise” builds on her earlier work, but it stands apart. The show implicates and involves its audience in the subject matter—something that would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with breaking news, reported inquiries, or documentary film. By doing so, the exhibit blurs the line between victims and perpetrators in America’s fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reader Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jared LeBrun, a student at the University of Texas at Austin—where a recent law will soon allow concealed weapons on campus—joins &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/all/2016/02/the-impact-of-guns-on-suicide/461805/"&gt;the ongoing gun debate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our attorney general, Ken Paxton, among others, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2015/12/paxton-gun-bans-in-public-schools-dorms-would-violate-campus-carry-law.html/" target="_blank"&gt;has called&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for guns to be allowed into college dormitories. … &lt;/span&gt;It is too easy to envision a scenario where a stressed-out college student is tired of relentless studying, or has received a poor grade on his final, and decides to take his life with the ease of reaching into his drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firearms are a uniquely dangerous method of committing &lt;span class="il"&gt;suicide&lt;/span&gt; for college students. Besides their far higher rate of efficacy than most methods of suicide, guns can be accessed by others as well. A gun owner can and should put his firearm in a safe, but that is not a part of the legislation. Thus the risk of &lt;span class="il"&gt;suicide &lt;/span&gt;can expand from the owner to those in the dorms around him or her, especially the owner’s roommate. Guns also present a much quicker method of &lt;span class="il"&gt;suicide&lt;/span&gt; that requires less deliberation, which is particularly dangerous in an environment where &lt;span class="il"&gt;suicides&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;happen most around finals—a short-term but high-stress event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <content xml:base="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/all/2016/02/the-impact-of-guns-on-suicide/461805/#note-462258" type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="360" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/02/8ea701b7b7a7e31d359fe1c3941900f0/dcec6eb9a.jpg" width="618"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the question I’m left with following this reader’s email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="il"&gt;Guns&lt;/span&gt; are used a lot for impulsive suicide, and assuming you believe reducing impulsive suicide is a good thing, then it would make sense to reduce the &lt;span class="il"&gt;guns&lt;/span&gt; that are available for people who might impulsively commit suicide. However, it does not follow, as several pro-&lt;span class="il"&gt;gun&lt;/span&gt; readers suggest, that this means confiscating &lt;span class="il"&gt;guns&lt;/span&gt; or denying legally barring potential suicides from getting &lt;span class="il"&gt;guns&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health programs can work through information dissemination and suasion. Right now, many people believe they (and their families) are safer with a &lt;span class="il"&gt;gun&lt;/span&gt; in their house than without a &lt;span class="il"&gt;gun&lt;/span&gt;. My reading of the data is that for many, probably most people, this is simply not true—that the possible safety benefit of having a &lt;span class="il"&gt;gun&lt;/span&gt; available is far outweighed by the risk of suicide or accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="il"&gt;Gun&lt;/span&gt; owners don’t like to hear that, perhaps because they believe they can “handle it,” they can manage the risks of &lt;span class="il"&gt;gun&lt;/span&gt; ownership and get only the safety upside. People also used to believe they could handle drinking and driving. People also used to believe they could protect their children by having them ride in their laps in cars. Some people still believe they can protect their children from disease through means other than vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those misconceptions have been challenged and in many cases eliminated through better information. The public health challenge is to come up with a way to convince people the presence of &lt;span class="il"&gt;guns&lt;/span&gt; make them less, not more, safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen any persuasive ad campaigns or other informational efforts along those lines, &lt;a href="mailto:hello@theatlantic.com"&gt;please let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;“Again, again!” That’s what a child might exclaim when he’s doing something fun. North Korea (the DPRK) &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/order-from-chaos/posts/2016/01/07-north-korea-pursuing-hydrogen-power-moon"&gt;tested its fourth nuclear device on January 6, 2016&lt;/a&gt;; it’s now toasted Lunar New Year with a missile launch, a day ahead of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/world/asia/north-korea-defying-warnings-prepares-long-range-rocket-launch.html"&gt;its announced window&lt;/a&gt; beginning February 8, 2016. Pyongyang is reaching for the stars while it has trouble growing enough food in its soil to nourish its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is the response from the outside? Another round of the same: expressions of “grave concern” and promises of “severe consequences.” Again, we see &lt;a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/order-from-chaos/posts/2016/02/02-us-sanctions-north-korea-nuclear-test-pollack"&gt;efforts to expand and tighten sanctions&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t know what the UN Security Council will manage to negotiate, given China’s reluctance toward giving more punch to the sanctions regime. But the governments of South Korea, Japan, and the United States are certainly making headway toward unilateral and multilateral sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how many exclamation points we add to words of disapproval, and no matter how many sanctions we generate, they are not likely to change North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Even though Banco Delta Asia (BDA) sanctions imposed in 2005 were deemed successful in hurting North Korea’s access to funds, there is good evidence that North Koreans learned to circumvent the financial blockade. Plenty of shadow banks and cash-only transactions in China happily service North Korea, and the latter country managed to increase international trade in the years following the imposition of the BDA sanctions, &lt;a href="http://blogs.piie.com/nk/?p=9647" target="_blank"&gt;even achieving a current-account surplus&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 for the first time in in its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;!-- END "MORE FROM" Custom --&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to discard or substantively revise old scripts to make sure that words and sanctions aren’t ignored in Pyongyang. Otherwise, like what happens to Bill Murray’s character in &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;, the cycle will repeat itself—and the repetition itself will become the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a few changes this time around in response to the alleged H-bomb test and the possibility of a rocket launch, and most of them would destabilize the region even more. The call for South Korea to develop its own nuclear arsenal (and not just rely on the U.S. security umbrella) has re-emerged and is gaining traction. After the February 2013 North Korean nuclear test, &lt;a href="http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/02/21/2013022100645.html" target="_blank"&gt;polls showed about 60 percent of respondents in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; believing their country should go nuclear. A &lt;a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/01/180_195722.html" target="_blank"&gt;Korea Gallup Poll&lt;/a&gt; revealed on January 15, 2016, that 54 percent favor developing nuclear weapons, with 38 percent against. But this time, more political leaders are also joining the nuclear bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, the missile-defense system and naval destroyers have been readied to shoot down incoming North Korean missiles, providing the Japanese government with a useful justification for an offense-capable military establishment and posture to face urgent contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, Kim Jong Un’s regime is determined to advancing its nuclear ambition. His mentality means international “punishments” don’t deter him or his leadership. If sanctions reduce the volume of luxury goods available to Kim’s supporters, who would complain, lest his or her head roll like those of so many others in recent years? Dry up North Korea’s access to financial networks to slow down the nuclear program? The regime will squeeze its population more. Yesterday just keeps repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-targeted sanctions and enforcement are no doubt in order. In addition to reducing access to hard cash, reducing the availability of materials for the nuclear program is key. However, much of the flow goes across the Chinese-North Korean border—not because the Chinese government wishes it, but because export controls in China are weak. Even legitimate trade in parts and technology, for example, between Germany and China, gets diverted to the North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea have repeatedly expected China to produce a better-behaved DPRK. But the United States was wrong from the outset, starting with the George W. Bush administration, to rely on China. The country’s own interests, not bilateral ties and regional stability, are what drive Beijing when it comes to the DPRK. Unless Chinese territory, the health of its citizens (through radiation exposure), and political stability are threatened, China will not act. We have no idea what the Chinese red line would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside North Korea, new realities aren’t auspicious for international cooperation. Kim Jong Un is not his father, Kim Jong Il. With the latter, other countries might have been able to negotiate a nuclear freeze or reduction in the long term, because the nuclear program was a means to an end: getting security assurances from the United States and economic access internationally. America had a genuine opening toward this end at the close of the Bill Clinton administration. But Kim Jong Un may not have a clear sense of means and ends, nor of the complexities of geopolitics and diplomacy. He seems to want nukes for the sake of nukes, without a clear strategic or diplomatic goal; &lt;span&gt;more and faster is better&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; made viewers yearn for a way out—how do we make tomorrow different from today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an idea: Throw North Korea out of the United Nations. The DPRK worked so hard to be admitted into the prestigious international club in 1991, but has flagrantly violated many of its rules and norms. Chapter II, Articles 5 and 6 of the UN Charter sanction suspension and restoration of “the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership.” Also, a member “which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this would involve a lot of controversy and politics. China and Russia would certainly oppose. But the point is this: Disregarding and disrespecting club rules should have severe consequences. North Korea seems to care more about international than bilateral ties, since it prizes the limelight and glamor of the global stage. When the World Economic Forum &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-13/north-korea-uninvited-to-davos-economic-forum-after-nuclear-test" target="_blank"&gt;dis-invited the DPRK from its January meeting in Davos&lt;/a&gt;, Pyongyang was visibly upset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries, in addition to Brazil and Malaysia, who have diplomatic ties and trade with the DPRK, could also recall their ambassadors from Pyongyang to make explicit their disapproval of its nuclear activities. And the gatekeepers of the Svalbard Treaty, which allows the exploration of the rich mineral resource and fish stocks in part of the Arctic, should consider revoking the DPRK’s recent entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These would be clear messages that even pro-engagement advocates have their limits. Let North Korea consider what its fate would be like if the world truly turned its back on the country.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;figcaption&gt;Carly Fiorina waiting to be introduced at a New Hampshire elementary-school event. &lt;cite&gt;David Goldman / AP&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;New Hampshire always has its casualties, and Carly Fiorina is its first. She’s expected to be followed shortly by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement Wednesday afternoon, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard announced she is suspending her campaign after a seventh-place finish in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Tuesday night, Fiorina insisted she’d keep fighting, but on Wednesday, she conceded it won’t be on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Election after election, the same empty promises are made and the same poll-tested stump speeches are given, but nothing changes,” &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarlyFiorina/posts/10157165012225206"&gt;Fiorina wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve said throughout this campaign that I will not sit down and be quiet. I’m not going to start now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="primary-categorization"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiorina’s last week on the campaign trail was a tough one. After finishing seventh in Iowa, she did not qualify for the main debate stage last Saturday—a major blow for a candidate whose poll numbers and name recognition once spiked after her well-received debate performances. In response, Fiorina launched a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/carly-fiorina-gop-debate/460107/"&gt;lobbying effort&lt;/a&gt;, with the support of some high-profile Republicans, to get ABC News to reconsider their qualifying criteria. When they didn’t, Fiorina blamed the network and the Republican National Committee for unfairly influencing the race. She no doubt ties her numbers in New Hampshire to being sidelined on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But New Hampshire was really just the last straw for a campaign that had more valleys than peaks. Fiorina launched her campaign eight months ago, her second effort to seek elected office after a failed bid to unseat Senator Barbara Boxer of California back in 2010. She positioned herself as a tech-savvy leader with a (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/25/carly-fiorinas-bogus-secretary-to-ceo-career-trajectory-fact-checker-biography/"&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;) rags-to-riches story who would bring private-sector smarts to Washington. She was also part of the 2016 primary’s trio of political outsiders, along with Ben Carson and Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of Fiorina’s problem was that she never had a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/what-happened-to-carly-fiorina/411451/"&gt;core constituency&lt;/a&gt; of voters to rely on. She wasn’t an establishment candidate, waiting for voters to lose their appetite for untested contenders. She wasn’t going to attract the powerful evangelical vote in Iowa. And she wasn’t enough of an outsider, like Trump seems to be, for voters’ imaginations to latch on to. (Well, their imaginations or their &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/trump-on-the-brink/453327/"&gt;lesser angels&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She saw small bursts of success early on in the overinflated primary, thanks to those well-reviewed debate performances. And she was particularly talented at retail politics, with her ground game supplemented by a super PAC that bore a lot of a campaign’s &lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/twentysixteen/2015/09/10/when-super-pac-acts-like-campaign"&gt;traditional burdens&lt;/a&gt;. As she repeatedly emphasized on the trail, many Americans had never heard of her before she hit prime time, and solid performances translated into improved polling. After appearing in the first undercard debate in August, she “broke through” to qualify for the main stage for the second contest, in September. But, as my colleague David Graham pointed out in October, a lack of debates in mid-fall led to some &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/what-happened-to-carly-fiorina/411451/"&gt;lost mojo&lt;/a&gt;, and Fiorina hasn’t really seen a surge since. In New Hampshire, according to exit polling, many voters waited until the last minute to choose their favorite candidate, and &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/09/politics/new-hampshire-primary-exit-entrance-polls/"&gt;roughly two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; said Saturday’s debate was a significant factor in their choice. Fiorina wasn’t even on the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the debates, as on the campaign trail, she always had her eyes on the general election. Fiorina seemed to mostly ignore her fellow candidates—save the &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/carly-fiorina-takes-donald-trump-task-face-faux-pas"&gt;requisite fight with Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;—preferring to volley criticism most often at Hillary Clinton. For much of the last few months, her critiques of Clinton in the campaign seemed relatively tame. (“You may not have decided who you’re going to vote for, but you would love to see me debate Hillary Clinton” is a &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/28/fiorina-clinton-escaped-prosecution-more-than-el-chapo/79482450/"&gt;common line&lt;/a&gt;; as is a &lt;a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/01/26/carly_fiorina_to_hillary_clinton_flying_is_an_activity_not_an_accomplishment.html"&gt;crack&lt;/a&gt; about Clinton’s frequent flying.) But at the last debate she appeared in, just ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Fiorina went personal, alleging that Clinton doesn’t like spending time with her husband. It was a low, if inevitable, moment in this increasingly volatile race, and one that seemed light-years away from the above-the-fray figure Fiorina cut at the beginning of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her announcement Wednesday, she lobbed one final volley the Clinton campaign’s way. Fiorina seemed to condemn Clinton supporter and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s assertion that “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other,” though she didn’t reference Albright by name. “To young girls and women across the country, I say: Do not let others define you,” Fiorina wrote. “Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you’re a woman. That is not feminism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She concluded the criticism with a description of what a true feminist is, and it seems to dovetail with precisely how Fiorina interprets her life story: “A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her God-given gifts. And always remember that a leader is not born, but made. Choose leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reader serves up some classic stop-motion from the ‘80s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Governor Christie is leaving the race, but I thought he deserved a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/all/2016/02/songs-inspired-by-presidential-candidates/462132/"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; anyway. This one is completely the fault of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, since Molly’s recent article, “&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-triumphant-return-of-chris-christie/460392/"&gt;The Triumphant Return of Chis Christie&lt;/a&gt;,” contained the phrase “the big man (this is a description of his personality, not his size)&lt;i&gt;.” &lt;/i&gt;A light bulb went on. With his out-sized gestures, booming voice and (some would say) big mouth, only one song could do him justice (and sorry, it’s not Springsteen): Peter Gabriel's “Big Time” from his mega album &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be an apt song for Rubio right now? Kasich? Carson? &lt;a href="mailto:hello@theatlantic.com"&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; if anything springs to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The Republican race is headed to South Carolina with two fewer candidates. The day after finishing sixth and seventh in the New Hampshire primaries, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina announced on Wednesday that they were suspending their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiorina was always a long shot—she was practically a political newcomer, having only run one unsuccessful Senate campaign. And while her record at HP was vulnerable to attack, Republican figures saw in her both private-sector experience and a woman who could counter Hillary Clinton’s monopoly on a “historic” woman’s candidacy. While many political professionals sniffed at Fiorina’s candidacy, remembering that 2010 Senate race, she broke out after a commanding performance in the undercard to the first Republican debate. That earned her a promotion to the main stage at the next debate, where she scored another victory. But it was all downhill from there. Dogged by questions of honesty and unable to earn media attention, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/what-happened-to-carly-fiorina/411451/"&gt;her campaign faded quickly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christie, on the other hand, entered the race as a front-runner. As the Republican Party went through a fractious nomination process in 2012—reluctant to acknowledge that Mitt Romney would get the nod—a group of powerful donors begged Christie to jump into the presidential race. But Christie demurred, saying he wasn’t ready to run after just 18 months as governor. Maybe later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the 2016 race rolled around, Christie thought he was ready to run. But by then, the donors weren’t begging him—and even if they had, the traditional GOP moneymen have been pushed far to the side this election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christie’s fall has been steep, matched only by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. As my colleague Molly Ball &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-triumphant-return-of-chris-christie/460392/"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, the Associated Press reported the news of Christie’s 2013 reelection by &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/christie-elected-governor-jersey-010312696--election.html"&gt;practically naming him the front-runner&lt;/a&gt;: “Gov. Chris Christie was re-elected with ease Tuesday, demonstrating the kind of broad, bipartisan appeal that will serve as his opening argument should he seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.” The early polls agreed: Until late January 2014, he led surveys of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was also, of course, when the George Washington Bridge scandal hit Christie. Although Christie himself hasn’t been directly tied to any wrongdoing, an investigation ensnared many of his closest aides, and whether or not prosecutors can prove the governor was involved, something didn’t smell right to many voters. &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-bridgegate-is-so-dangerous-to-chris-christies-reputation/282956/"&gt;The scandal cut right to Christie’s core&lt;/a&gt;: He had built his reputation on credibility and competence, and the idea that a major political vendetta that ensnarled traffic across state lines had been hatched in his office without his knowledge was a serious to blow to at least one of those. Christie’s &lt;a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/chris-christie-favorable-rating"&gt;favorability rating&lt;/a&gt; took a nosedive and never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christie managed to float back to the top of the polls late in 2014, but then Jeb Bush jumped into the race—remember when that was a game-changer?—followed by Donald Trump. Christie never recovered the lead. He decided to throw a hail-Mary pass in New Hampshire, hoping that his no-nonsense demeanor and proximity would resonate in the state. Christie does seem to have &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/new-hampshire-primary-results/461919/"&gt;dealt a body blow&lt;/a&gt; to Senator Marco Rubio in the last debate before the primary, but it didn’t help him, and he couldn’t break double-digits. From there, it was hard to see a path for him going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it Bridgegate that killed Christie’s chances? Perhaps, but this a whodunit with more than one suspect. The first damaging moment came on the eve of the 2012 election, when Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey. President Obama came to visit the Garden State, and Christie welcomed him—&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/the-chris-christie-backlash-machine-revs-into-high-gear/264910/"&gt;much to the fury of Republicans who wanted him to snub the president&lt;/a&gt;. Romney aides blamed Christie for their loss, though it probably didn’t make much difference, and Christie said it was unacceptable to snub a sitting president when his state needed federal help. Many in his party never forgave him, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Bridgegate scandal had broken, the rest of Christie’s record in New Jersey started to seem less positive, too. There were the &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/02/donna-brazile/dem-pundit-brazile-says-nj-credit-rating-fell-reco/"&gt;nine credit downgrades&lt;/a&gt; the state suffered during his term. There was the collapse of Atlantic City, too. Besides, Christie was always on the liberal side of the GOP. Even if he was to the right of the class of New England Republicans, he wasn’t a great fit in today’s party. He was a consummate insider in a year of outsiders, and the field was jam-packed with moderate, technocratic governors and former governors: Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it might have seem otherwise back in early 2014, it appears that, contrary to the words of &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/jersey-boys/309019/"&gt;his idol’s hit&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Christie was not born to run—at least not for this office, in this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the field has shrunk considerably, there’s still a crowded slate of candidates. &lt;span&gt;To help out with that, this cheat sheet on the state of the presidential field will be periodically updated throughout the campaign season. Here’s how things look right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Republicans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="179" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/07/6872040125_bffe231944_z/aba01f9aa.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JIM GILMORE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Right? Gilmore was governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. Before that, he chaired the Republican National Committee for a year. In 2008, he ran for Senate in Virginia and lost to Mark Warner by 31 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/former-va-gov-jim-gilmore-files-paperwork-presidential-run-n400626"&gt;He filed his papers on July 29&lt;/a&gt;, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/screen_shot_2015-11-02_at_8.05.00_pm.jpg"&gt;Holy Freudian slip, Batman&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ad-unit-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="John Kasich" height="179" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/kasich/c5092995c.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JOHN KASICH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The current Ohio governor ran once before, in 2000, after a stint as Republican budget guru in the House. Between then and his election in 2010, he worked at Lehman Brothers. &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/john-kasich-2016/391772/"&gt;Molly Ball wrote a definitive profile in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. His announcement was July 21, 2015, at the Ohio State University in Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
White-collar Republicans. Kasich’s pitch: He has got better fiscal-conservative bona fides than any other candidate in the race, he has proved he can win blue-collar voters, and he has won twice in a crucial swing state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win the nomination? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kasich delivered a strong second-place finish in New Hampshire, following through on his strategy. For the moment, that makes him the leader in the establishment-technocrat-governor lane of the race. But his national polling remains bad, and he has a lot of catching up to do elsewhere. Can he sustain his momentum beyond the Granite State?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="line-height: 1.66667;"&gt;What else do we know? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Kasich bought a Roots CD and hated it so much he threw it out of his car window. John Kasich hated the Coen brothers’ classic &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt; so much he tried to get his local Blockbuster to quit renting it. &lt;a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/544507/KASICH-IS-ENERGY-PERSONIFIED.html?pg=all"&gt;George Will laughed at him&lt;/a&gt;. John Kasich is the Bill Brasky of philistinism. John Kasich probably &lt;a href="https://screen.yahoo.com/tales-bill-brasky-airport-bar-000000422.html"&gt;hated that skit, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="174" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/06/Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore/c03e407e1.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DONALD TRUMP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
America’s sweetheart—well, America’s high-school sweetheart, the one you get embarrassed thinking about decades later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A shocking portion of the Republican primary electorate; Democrats; &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/31/the-fearful-and-the-frustrated"&gt;white supremacists&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the Republican field, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/standing-athwart-history-yelling-stop-donald-trump/426504/"&gt;its intellectual luminaries&lt;/a&gt;, however, are horrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After a huge win in New Hampshire, Trump is back on top. So, uh, maybe he’ll be the nominee after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;figure style="display: inline-block;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="240" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/02/giphy_2/e58866c0e.gif" width="320"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He cheats at golf&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/does-donald-trump-cheat-at-golf-a-washington-post-investigation/2015/09/02/f8a940b2-50c4-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html"&gt;probably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="171" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Jeb_Bush_by_Gage_Skidmore/32209ed7d.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JEB BUSH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The brother and son of presidents, Bush served two terms as governor of Florida, from 1999 to 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, as of June 15, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Establishment Republicans; &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/09/politics/g-w-bush-on-jeb-2016/"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;; major Wall Street donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win the nomination? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The good news for Bush: He did better than expected in New Hampshire. The bad news for Bush: That’s still a long way back, and he’ll have to climb a long way back to be a contender. Bush’s campaign is a case study in how money isn’t everything. Despite the $100 million super PAC backing him, Bush has been a feckless, adrift candidate. Every now and then a poll will show him rising to, oh, fourth or something, and there will be rumors of a Bush comeback. But one look at his unfavorables shows why he has pretty much been written off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://jeb2016.com/404?lang=en"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;a href="http://jeb2016.com/404?lang=es"&gt;y &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jeb2016.com/404?lang=es"&gt;en español también&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="171" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Ben_Carson_by_Gage_Skidmore_2/86c393cf1.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;BEN CARSON&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A celebrated former head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/meet-dr-ben-carson-the-new-conservative-folk-hero/273240/"&gt;Carson became a conservative folk hero&lt;/a&gt; after a broadside against Obamacare at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. He announced May 4, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Grassroots conservatives. Carson has an incredibly appealing personal story—a voyage from poverty to pathbreaking neurosurgery—and none of the taint of politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. He’s done. If it’s any consolation, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-audacity-of-ben-carson-and-carly-fiorina/392210/"&gt;history weighed heavily against Carson’s chances all along&lt;/a&gt;: Not since Dwight Eisenhower has either party nominated anyone without prior elected experience for the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/63682c308/47b13d86b.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;MARCO RUBIO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A second-generation Cuban-American and former speaker of the Florida House, Rubio was catapulted to national fame in the 2010 Senate election, after he unexpectedly upset Governor Charlie Crist to win the GOP nomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, he announced on April 13, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rubio enjoys establishment support. He has sought to position himself as the candidate of an interventionist foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For a second after Iowa, it looked like Rubio’s plan was coming together perfectly. Then came his debate collapse and distant finish in New Hampshire. That called into question his ability to consolidate the anti-Trump, anti-Cruz faction of the Republican Party, and suddenly his path looks much rockier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s &lt;a href="https://marcorubio.com/404"&gt;decent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Ted_Cruz_official_portrait_113th_Congress/5640b30ae.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TED CRUZ&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cruz served as deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed Texas solicitor general in 2003. In 2012, he ran an insurgent campaign to beat a heavily favored establishment Republican for Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. He &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/reformists-and-retros-battle-for-the-gop/388562/"&gt;launched his campaign March 23, 2015, at Liberty University in Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hard-core conservatives; Tea Partiers who worry that Rand Paul is too dovish on foreign policy; social conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It looks more likely than ever, especially after his commanding Iowa victory over Trump. Once dismissed as too conservative and too hated by even fellow Republicans, Cruz’s stock has risen over the course of the fall. But Cruz still contends with the fact that &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/is-the-republican-establishment-ganging-up-on-ted-cruz/425145/"&gt;much of his party absolutely despises him&lt;/a&gt;, so much so that they’re willing to back Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Democrats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="188" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop/3869445ff.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;HILLARY CLINTON&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As if we have to tell you, but: She’s a trained attorney, former secretary of state in the Obama administration, former senator from New York, and former first lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is she running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/an-unabashedly-liberal-hillary-clinton/390339/"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants her to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most of the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can she win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yep. But could she lose it, too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The real puzzler, after so many years with Clinton on the national scene, is what we don’t know. &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/10-questions-about-the-hillary-clinton-campaign/390225/"&gt;Here are 10 central questions to ask about the Hillary Clinton campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does her website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you’re tolerant of bad puns and &lt;s&gt;’90s &lt;/s&gt; ’80s outfits, &lt;a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/404"&gt;the answer is yes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/01/2abf0eef0/9c4bd80f3.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;BERNIE SANDERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A self-professed socialist, Sanders represented Vermont     in the U.S. House from 1991 to 2007, when he won a seat in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is he running?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. He announced April 30, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Far-left Democrats; Brooklyn-accent aficionados; progressives who worry that a second Clinton administration would be far too friendly to the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When Sanders launched his campaign, this question seemed beside the point. That’s no longer true: Sanders is running neck and neck or even ahead of Clinton in key early primary states and regularly drawing larger crowds than her. After narrowly losing in Iowa and trouncing Clinton in New Hampshire, he’s starting to narrow the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://berniesanders.com/404"&gt;Yes, and it is quintessentially Sanders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is he? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The billionaire finance-and-technology entrepreneur was &lt;s&gt;benevolent dictator &lt;/s&gt;mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is he running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, but there have been &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/01/michael-bloomberg-cant-quite-give-up-his-presidential-dreams/423504/"&gt;trial balloons launched in the press&lt;/a&gt;. On February 8, he told &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span&gt;“I find the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters.” &lt;/span&gt;He will reportedly decide by March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wants him to run?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/stop-trying-to-make-bloomberg-happen/411514/"&gt;If the past is any indication&lt;/a&gt;, it’s mostly Bloomberg aides. Supposedly, Bloomberg is terrified of a Trump vs. Sanders race and would run if that was the matchup. Is there a base for Bloomberg, a fiscally conservative but socially liberal abrasive New Yorker? Seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are his prospects? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bloomberg himself has &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/stop-trying-to-make-bloomberg-happen/411514/"&gt;repeatedly belittled&lt;/a&gt; his own electability, either as an individual or, in the abstract, as a third-party candidate. And he’s probably right. It’s hard to imagine who would vote for him, especially if Clinton wins the Democratic nod: He’s slightly to the right of her, but Republicans hate him, and he makes her seem like Miss Congeniality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please. This is a guy who &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/business/media/joshua-topolsky-web-chief-bloomberg-leaving.html?_r=2&amp;amp;referrer="&gt;doesn’t even think websites are necessary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/01/7671b43ff/d8454fb7d.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JIM WEBB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Webb is a Vietnam War hero, author, and former secretary of the Navy. He served as a senator from Virginia from 2007 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not at the moment. Webb launched a Democratic bid July 2, 2015, but dropped it October 20, 2015. He has since made noises about mounting an independent campaign, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/jim-webb-takes-step-toward-independent-presidential-campaign/2016/01/07/ee8ed51e-b560-11e5-a76a-0b5145e8679a_story.html?postshare=8681452199221138&amp;amp;tid=ss_tw"&gt;hiring a fundraiser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a Democrat, doves; the Anybody-But-Hillary camp; &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/for-the-record-i-hope-jim-webb-runs/385599/"&gt;my colleague James Fallows&lt;/a&gt;. As an Independent? Maybe some of the same &lt;span&gt;socially conservative, economically populist Democrats who backed him before. But he barely registered in the race the first time around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are his prospects? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bad. Every independent candidate is at best a very long shot, and Webb’s weaknesses—dislike for campaigning, weak fundraising, heterodox views—were on clear display during his Democratic bid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ad-unit-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/01/355px_Jill_Stein_2012/a38bd0f3e.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JILL STEIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Massachusetts resident and physician, she is a candidate of nearly Stassen-like frequency, having run for president  in 2012 and a slew of other offices before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is she running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes. Stein &lt;a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/6/22/exclusive_green_partys_jill_stein_announces"&gt;announced in June 2015&lt;/a&gt; that she would again seek the nomination of the Green Party, which she won in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants her to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Stein seems to have strong support with the Green Party. She managed to collect nearly 500,000 votes in 2012—the party’s strongest showing since Ralph Nader’s disastrous 2000 run but well short of the 2.9 million votes he got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are her prospects? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She seems well placed to win the nomination. Her rivals include Darryl Cherney, a musician the FBI once &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/print/2012/mar/25/entertainment/la-ca-earth-first-doc-20120325"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; of bombing himself, and Bill Kreml, a Taoist professor emeritus of political science. It’s too soon to speculate how she might fare in the general election compared with 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does her website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Possibly not original, but kind of &lt;a href="http://www.jill2016.com/404"&gt;soothing and on-message&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/01/390px_Garyjohnsonphoto_modified/9e4d28be6.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GARY JOHNSON&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oh come on, you remember Gary! He ran for the GOP nomination in 2012 and then got the Libertarian Party   nod after that didn’t work out. He was previously a two-term governor of New Mexico. He now runs a company  that sells &lt;a href="http://www.hilozenge.com/"&gt;THC lozenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sure is. He &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/gary-johnson-president-announcement-2016/422964/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; his attempt for an encore performance with the Libertarian Party on January 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As his company’s site &lt;a href="http://www.hilozenge.com/#!gary-johnson/c1kzz"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;span class="color_11"&gt;Now that he’s associated with what is being hailed the best legal cannabis product on the market, Gary may be drafted for President of the United States by a grateful nation one day.” &lt;/span&gt;Johnson is also an unusually talented and successful politician to vie for the Libertarian line. The 1.3 million votes he collected in 2012 were the party’s all-time high&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are his prospects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He’s running against the &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/12/24/mcafee-run-libertarian-party-candidate-president/77877980/"&gt;outlandish oddball former tech titan John McAfee in the party&lt;/a&gt;, so that looks good. But of his general-election chances, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/gary-johnson-president-announcement-2016/422964/"&gt;he told my colleague Nora Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;“I have no delusions of grandeur here. I know what happened last time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;No.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;big&gt;Out of the Running&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Republicans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="169" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/04/Carly_Fiorina_by_Gage_Skidmore/3725b87a5.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CARLY FIORINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is she? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fiorina rose through the ranks to become CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005, before being ousted in an acrimonious struggle. She advised John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign and unsuccessfully challenged Senator Barbara Boxer of California in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is she running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No longer. Fiorina dropped out on February 10, following a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wanted her to run?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
She was a business-friendly candidate with a talent for a sharp turn of phrase or jab. But it was never exactly clear what Fiorina’s constituency was going to be, and a strong following never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could she have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Fiorina couldn’t crack 5 percent in New Hampshire and was already off the debate stages when she dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What else do we know? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fiorina’s unsuccessful 2010 Senate race against Barbara Boxer produced two of the most entertaining and wacky political ads ever, “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo_Ejfc5hW8"&gt;Demon Sheep&lt;/a&gt;” and the nearly eight-minute epic commonly known as “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJKlc77K5dg"&gt;The Boxer Blimp&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did her website have a good 404 page?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Chris_Christie_2011_Shankbone/8930a1bf5.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;David Shankbone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CHRIS CHRISTIE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is he? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What’s it to you, buddy? The combative New Jerseyan             is in his second term as governor and previously served       as a U.S. attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is he running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No longer. He suspended his campaign on February 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Moderate and establishment Republicans who don’t like Jeb Bush or John Kasich; top businessmen, &lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/chris-christie-s-biggest-backer-would-i-write-a-check-for-10-million-no-20150630"&gt;led by Home Depot founder Ken Langone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maybe in 2012. This year, Christie staked his chances on New Hampshire, and he ended up a distant eighth. On the evening of February 9, he suggested he might drop out soon. But Christie was already probably toast. The tide of opinion had turned against Christie even before the “Bridgegate” indictments. Citing his horrific favorability numbers, &lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/chris-christies-bridgegate-2016-president/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight &lt;/em&gt;bluntly punned&lt;/a&gt; that “Christie's access lanes to the GOP nomination are closed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We would have gone with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FqQHqLCWHrjy9i%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHl6pe-YSkB5eAWH-QDvVHMNTN2VQ"&gt;the GIF&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.chrischristie.com/404"&gt;sure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Rick_Santorum_by_Gage_Skidmore_5/ec1b33c98.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;RICK SANTORUM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is he?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Santorum represented Pennsylvania in the Senate from 1995 until his defeat in 2006. He was the runner-up for  the GOP nomination in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is he running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. He will dropped out on February 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wanted him to run? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Social conservatives. The former Pennsylvania senator didn't have an obvious constituency in 2012, yet he still went a long way, and Foster Friess, who bankrolled much of Santorum's campaign then, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/14/gop-donor-foster-friess-launches-new-effort-to-boost-rick-santorum/"&gt;is ready for another round&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Never. As much as Santorum &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/for-santorum-and-others-not-in-top-10-grin-and-bear-it-and-be-a-little-bitter/2015/08/07/c5725bee-3cc3-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html"&gt;felt he deserved more respect&lt;/a&gt; for his 2012 showing, neither voters nor the press seemed inclined to give it to him, and he remained trapped in the basement. Even in Iowa, which he narrowly won in 2012, he came in almost last, ahead of only Jim Gilmore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is he?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An ophthalmologist and the son of libertarian icon Ron Paul, he rode the 2010 Republican wave to the Senate, representing Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is he running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. He suspended his campaign on February 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some Ron Paul fans; Tea Partiers; libertarians; civil libertarians; noninterventionist Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once &lt;a href="http://time.com/3512769/in-the-latest-issue-10/"&gt;tabbed by &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the most interesting man in politics, he failed to elicit much interest from voters. The deathwatch stories in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/13/rand-paul-makes-the-main-cnn-debate-the-math-says-he-shouldnt-have/"&gt;December&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article36726486.html"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/02/rand-paul-absolutely-not-looking-leaving-race/73220024/"&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;) were clearly premature, but they weren’t wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="171" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Mike_Huckabee_by_Gage_Skidmore_2/8f9e16b27.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;MIKE HUCKABEE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is he? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An ordained preacher, a former governor of Arkansas,     and a Fox News host, he ran a strong campaign in 2008, finishing third, but sat out in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is he running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Huckabee dropped out on February 1 after pulling less than 2 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wanted him to run? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Social conservatives; evangelical Christians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Evangelicals, his old base, flocked to Ted Cruz instead. Huckabee’s answer was to play a populist, but that never really took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikehuckabee.com/404"&gt;It’s pretty good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A senator from South Carolina, he’s John McCain’s closest ally in the small caucus of Republicans who are moderate on many issues but very hawkish on foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No sir. Graham kicked off the campaign June 1, 2015, but suspended it on December 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-29/lindsey-graham-2016-now-john-mccain-approved"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, naturally; &lt;a href="http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2015/03/03/lindsey-graham-raises-money-netanyahu-speech/24340855/"&gt;Senator Kelly Ayotte, possibly&lt;/a&gt;; Joe Lieberman, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abortion-rjc-graham-cruz_566077a0e4b072e9d1c5013a"&gt;But he had some fun in losing it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Graham promised to have a rotating first lady if he wins. &lt;a href="http://etch-production.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/posts/f9/e1/00/f9e1000000000000.gif"&gt;We were rooting for Lana del Rey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Rhodes Scholar, he’s the outgoing governor of Louisiana. He previously served in the U.S. House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. He kicked off his campaign on June 24, 2015, but suspended it on November 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It was hard to say. Jindal assiduously courted conservative Christians, both with a powerful conversion story (he was raised Hindu but converted to Catholicism in high school) and policies (after other governors reversed course, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/bobby-jindal-hb-707-and-the-2016-presidential-race/393833/"&gt;he charged forward with a religious-freedom law&lt;/a&gt;). But he still trailed other social conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Jindal never gained traction at the national level, faced an overcrowded field of social conservatives, and his stewardship of Louisiana &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/governors-tactics-at-center-of-louisiana-budget-vortex.html"&gt;came in for harsh criticism&lt;/a&gt; even from staunch fiscal conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1994, he wrote an article called “&lt;a href="http://www.newoxfordreview.org/article.jsp?did=1294-jindal"&gt;Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare&lt;/a&gt;,” in which he described a friend’s apparent exorcism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bobbyjindal.com/404"&gt;Meh&lt;/a&gt;. Good joke, but past its expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Rick_Perry_by_Gage_Skidmore_8/640fb9f04.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;RICK PERRY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
George W. Bush’s successor as governor of Texas, he entered the 2012 race with high expectations but   sputtered out quickly. He left office in 2014 as the Lone Star State’s longest-serving governor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. He announced on June 4, 2015, but dropped out of the race on September 11, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bueller?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Perry promoters insisted that Rick 2016 was a polished, smart campaigner, totally different from the meandering, spacey Perry of 2012. It didn’t seemed to matter in this field. Perry had to quit paying his staff in South Carolina and &lt;a href="http://www.wmur.com/politics/rick-perrys-new-hampshire-campaign-staff-is-no-more/35061726"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, and was &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/31/rick-perrys-woes-continue-as-iowa-staff-is-cut-to-one-person/"&gt;down to a single staffer in Iowa&lt;/a&gt; when he dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That depends. &lt;a href="https://rickperry.org/error"&gt;Is this an “oops” joke?&lt;/a&gt; If so, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ad-unit-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="169" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Sarah_Palin_September_4_2014_cropped/52935af4b.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SARAH PALIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you have to ask now, you must not have been around in 2008. That’s when John McCain selected the then-unknown Alaska governor as his running mate. After the ticket lost, she resigned her term early and became a television personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is she running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, despite a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/25/sarah-palin-iowa-speech_n_6543762.html?utm_hp_ref=politics"&gt;bizarre speech in January&lt;/a&gt; 2015 that made a compelling case both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants her to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Palin still has diehard grassroots fans, but there are fewer than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can she win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will she announce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="170" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Mitt_Romney_by_Gage_Skidmore_7/97db219f3.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;MITT ROMNEY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Republican nominee in 2012 was also governor of Massachusetts and a successful businessman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Probably not, but who knows! &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/mitt-romneys-terrible-timing/385013/"&gt;He announced in late January 2015 that he would step aside&lt;/a&gt;, but now &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/romneys-horror-at-trump-renews-mitt-2016-talk.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York &lt;/em&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump boom has him reconsidering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Former staffers; &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/us/politics/romneys-consideration-of-candidacy-is-closely-tied-to-his-faith-allies-say.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;amp;emc=edit_th_20150126"&gt;prominent Mormons&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-hillary-clinton-advisers-prefer-face-romney-article-1.2078292"&gt;Hillary Clinton’s team&lt;/a&gt;. Romney polled well, but it’s hard to tell what his base would have been. Republican voters weren’t exactly ecstatic about him in 2012, and that was before he ran a listless, unsuccessful campaign. &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/mitt-romney-2016-election-114310.html"&gt;Party leaders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://time.com/3679568/romney-campaign-donors/"&gt;past donors&lt;/a&gt; were skeptical at best of a third try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He proved the answer was yes, but it didn't seem likely to happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ad-unit-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="182" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/John_Bolton_by_Gage_Skidmore/a4b5eaaa8.jpg" width="157"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JOHN BOLTON&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A strident critic of the United Nations and a leading   hawk, he was George W. Bush’s ambassador to the   United Nations for 17 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/05/14/john-bolton-announces-he-is-not-running-for-president/"&gt;Nope&lt;/a&gt;. After announcing his announcement, in the style of the big-time candidates, he posted on Facebook that he wasn’t running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even among super-hawks, he didn’t seem to be a popular pick, likely because he had no political experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
They say anything is possible in politics, but this would test the rule. A likelier outcome could be a plum foreign-policy role in a hawkish GOP presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="168" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Scott_Walker_by_Gage_Skidmore/3624c83f2.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Gage Skidmore&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SCOTT WALKER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Elected governor of Wisconsin in 2010, Walker earned conservative love and liberal hate for his anti-union policies. In 2013, he defeated a recall effort, and he won reelection the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Walker dropped out of the race on September 21, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Walker was a favorite of conservatives who detest the labor movement because of his union-busting in Wisconsin. He attracted interest from the Koch brothers, and some establishment Republicans saw him as the perfect marriage of executive know-how, business-friendly credentials, and social conservatism without culture-warrior baggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For months, Walker was considered—along with Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio—a top-tier contender for the nomination. Hurricane Trump hurt all three, but none more than Walker. After largely fading from view during the second presidential debate, he &lt;a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/20/rel10a.pdf"&gt;polled below 1 percent&lt;/a&gt; in a national CNN poll. Perhaps a radically different campaign would have produced a different result, but Walker didn’t seem ready for national prime time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottwalker.com/error"&gt;Aye, matey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="176" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/Governor_Pataki_2015_2/cf23662d3.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Michael Vadon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GEORGE PATAKI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pataki ousted incumbent Governor Mario Cuomo in     1994 and served three terms as governor of New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. He announced his entry on May 28, 2015, but dropped out on December 29—using the free TV time he’d won to compensate for Donald Trump’s &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Apparently no one: His &lt;em&gt;RealClearPolitics &lt;/em&gt;average by the time he dropped out was a neat 0.0. Establishment Northeastern Republicans once held significant sway over the party, but those days have long since passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could have have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did his website have a good 404 page?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Democrats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="164" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/f71798517/ece0e27ec.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="15" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" title="Click and drag to move" width="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;MARTIN O'MALLEY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is he?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He’s a former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is he running?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. O’Malley announced he was suspending his campaign after getting less than 1 percent in the February 1 Iowa caucus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who wanted him to run? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not clear. He has some of the leftism of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but without the same grassroots excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Why O’Malley—who says all the right progressive things—couldn’t gain any momentum among progressives who seem eager for Sanders, for Warren, really for anyone but Clinton, is a fascinating conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What else do we know?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/03/20/young-dems-serenaded-by-omalley/"&gt;Have&lt;/a&gt; you &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-omalley-irishfestival-september99-story.html"&gt;heard&lt;/a&gt; that he &lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/that-time-i-got-bounced-from-a-martin-o-malley-concert-20150320"&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Martin-OMalley-to-rock-New-Hampshire-this-St-Patricks-Day.html"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; rock &lt;a href="http://delmarvapublicradio.net/post/governor-omalleys-celtic-rock-bands-saturday-night-gig"&gt;band&lt;/a&gt;?

Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="187" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/08/Lessig_portrait/a4e3ace79.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;LAWRENCE LESSIG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lessig is a professor at Harvard Law School, a political activist, and an &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/author/lawrence-lessig/"&gt;occasional &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; contributor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Having &lt;a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252868-lessig-on-2016-im-in"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a run in early September, he &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4IsqmMqCEo&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;dropped out on November 2&lt;/a&gt;, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lessig’s campaign was designed to cater almost exclusively to the many Americans who are upset about the influence of money in politics. He pitched himself as a “referendum president” who would pass his proposed Citizens Equality Act of 2017, which would enact universal voting registration, campaign-finance limits, and anti-gerrymandering provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. In dropping out, he cited his inability to break into the Democratic debates, but given his lack of electoral experience, his idiosyncratic platform, and &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/2014-elections-mayday-pac-larry-lessig-112617"&gt;the track record of his Mayday PAC&lt;/a&gt; in the 2014 election, he never really had a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a season six episode of &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://westwing.wikia.com/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig"&gt;fictional Lessig&lt;/a&gt; (played by Christopher Lloyd) worked with the White House to write a new constitution for Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“&lt;a href="https://lessigforpresident.com/404"&gt;Sorry, we’re too busy fixing democracy to design a clever 404 page!&lt;/a&gt;” You have time now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="176" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/05/AP826523897342/40c378ed0.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Steven Senne / AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;LINCOLN CHAFEE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The son of beloved Rhode Island politician John Chafee, Linc took his late father’s seat in the U.S. Senate, serving   as a Republican. He was governor, first as an Independent and then as a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Chafee announced his run on June 3, 2015, but ended it October 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can meet all 10 of them in &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/21/450336018/meet-lincoln-chafees-donors"&gt;this great NPR piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. Chafee’s showing in the first debate was so bad that even Wolf Blitzer begged him to get out for his own reputation’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does his website have a good 404 page? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ad-unit-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="187" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Joe_Biden_official_portrait_crop2/1963a9ef5.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JOE BIDEN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is he? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Biden is the vice president and the foremost American advocate for aviator sunglasses and passenger rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No. After lengthy deliberation, Biden &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/biden-bows-out/411721/"&gt;ruled out a run on October 21&lt;/a&gt;, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wanted him to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The original driving force for the run seems to have been the late Beau Biden, along with his brother, Hunter. An outside group called Draft Biden (slogan: “I’m Ridin’ With Biden”) tried to coax him in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could he have won the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s highly doubtful. Even when Hillary Clinton was at her weakest, she had huge organizational advantages. And past presidential campaigns showed that Biden, while compelling, could be an undisciplined, self-defeating candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;figure class="right"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="169" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2015/01/Elizabeth_Warren_Official_113th_Congressional_Portrait_/14a95635b.jpg" width="150"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ELIZABETH WARREN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is she?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Warren has taken an improbable path from Oklahoma, to Harvard Law School, to progressive heartthrob, to Massachusetts senator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is she running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Are you still scrolling down here to check? Not a chance, amigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who wants her to run? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Progressive Democrats; economic populists; &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/12/12/ex-obama-campaign-staff-join-ready-for-warren/"&gt;disaffected Obamans&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/run-warren-run/384490/"&gt;disaffected Bushites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can she win the nomination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, because &lt;a href="http://fortune.com/2015/01/13/elizabeth-warren-sheila-bair/"&gt;she’s not running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/02/shutterstock_110240555/lead_large.jpg" height="410" width="615" /&gt;
                            &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was a time, not long ago, when computers—mere assemblages of silicon and wire and plastic that can fly planes, drive cars, translate languages, and keep failing hearts beating—could really, truly still surprise us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One such moment came on February 10, 1996, at a convention center in Philadelphia. Two chess players met for the first of six tournament matches. Garry Kasparov, the Soviet grandmaster,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was the World Chess champion, famous for his aggressive and uncompromising style of play. Deep Blue was a 6-foot-5-inch, 2,800-pound supercomputer designed by a team of IBM scientists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There was no way that this tin box was going to defeat a reigning world champion,” says Maurice Ashley, an American grand chessmaster who provided live commentary for the game that day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kasparov thought so, too. He’d previously &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.disi.unige.it/person/DelzannoG/AI2/hsu.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;scoffed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at the suggestion that a chess-playing computer might defeat a grandmaster before the year 2000, which, back then, probably seemed pretty ridiculous to most people. Personal computers were just over a decade old, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsdesk.si.edu/snapshot/apple-classic-macintosh-personal-computer"&gt;&lt;span&gt;looked liked this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Commercial companies had begun providing Internet access to the general public only the year before. Chess required guile, wit, and foresight—distinctly human traits—and a hunk of hardware, the chess community thought, could not replicate all that—at least not well enough to beat Kasparov.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the tin box won that game, becoming the first computer to defeat a sitting world chess champion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chess players and computer scientists alike were stunned. Computers were by then known for doing some things better than humans could, like solving complex math problems or processing employees’ paychecks. “But everybody knew that chess required intelligence to play well, so to see that a computer could do this and compete with the best player in the world—that was sort of a wakeup call,” says Murray Campbell, one of the IBM computer scientists who developed Deep Blue, and a competitive chess player himself. “It was a sign that a lot more was coming.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.disi.unige.it/person/DelzannoG/AI2/hsu.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;concept of chess-playing machines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; dates back centuries. One of the first iterations was rather dishonest: an automaton created by Wolfgang von Kempelen, a Hungarian inventor, in the 1760s only managed to win because the human player hidden inside was pulling levers to move pieces across the board. It took humans until the 1950s to program machines to observe the rules of chess. By the 1980s, computers could conduct basic searches of potential moves and strategies, but at considerably quick speeds, searching several thousands positions per second. They started competing against skilled human players—and winning. In 1987, Deep Thought, the precursor to Deep Blue, defeated British chessmaster David Levy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Deep Thought sees far but notices little, remembers everything but learns nothing, neither erring egregiously nor rising above its normal strength,” the IBM scientists &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.disi.unige.it/person/DelzannoG/AI2/hsu.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;wrote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 1990. “Even so, it sometimes produces insights that are overlooked by even top grandmasters.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deep Blue was considerably more advanced. At its core, the computer was built to solve complex numerical problems. In front of a chess board, Deep Blue, equipped with data from hundreds of existing master games, would scan the board for features it recognized. Like a human player, the computer thought ahead, exploring potential moves in terms of sequences, envisioning future positions. It numerically rated the moves as it went, finally making the one that came out with the highest rating—the “best” move. Deep Blue was capable of evaluating 100 million positions per second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kasparov went into the historic game in 1996 feeling confident, but it soon became clear Deep Blue was a tougher competitor than he’d expected. Kasparov, already known for being an animated player, was visibly frustrated during the game, often shaking his head, says Jeffrey Popyack, a computer science professor at Drexel University who was in the room. At one point, Kasparov spent 27 minutes deliberating before moving his queen. “The thing that really sticks with me now was just the anguish that Kasparov was going through,” Popyack recalls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toward the end of game, Kasparov and Deep Blue were like “two sumo wrestlers battling one another at the edge of a high cliff,” as Monty Newborn, chairman of the computer chess committee for the Association of Computing Machines, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rWPgBwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA98&amp;amp;lpg=PA98&amp;amp;dq=kasparov+deep+blue+move+29+attack+king+pawn&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=UqoXcz7TK0&amp;amp;sig=htyozWmPtBcNJrFqkqJKqcDeL7M&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKyu-R5e3KAhXJwj4KHUelAmAQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=kasparov%20deep%20blue%20move%2029%20attack%20king%20pawn&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;once put it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Kasparov was mounting an aggressive attack on Deep Blue’s king when the machine made an unusual move—going after a pawn across the board—that suggested the machine was unaware it was in trouble. (“It would be kind of like your house was burning down and you decided to go grocery shopping,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ashley, the American grandmaster,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said.) Turns out the computer had calculated that Kasparov’s move—a bold bluff that would have intimidated a human player—wasn’t going to work. The world champion, visibly distraught, resigned a few moves later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern, game-playing artificial intelligence is, well, even scarier. In 2011, Watson, an IBM super computer capable of answering open-ended questions posed in human language &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/how-did-supercomputer-watson-beat-jeopardy-champion-ken-jennings-experts-discuss/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;defeated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ken Jennings on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Last month, a computing system developed by Google researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-a-huge-breakthrough-googles-ai-beats-a-top-player-at-the-game-of-go/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the top human player of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a complex 2,500-year-old game that depends heavily on intuition and strategy. (Popyack points out that, despite all that, computers are still not very good at programming other computers.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Human players are successful if they can spot their opponents’ blind spots, and supercomputers are built to find even the smallest of errors and exploit them. “It’s never going to get tired, and it’s never going to get overconfident, and it’s just going to kill you,” Ashley said. “That’s the difference now. It’s like playing the Terminator.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kasparov rebounded in the second game against Deep Blue, and went on to win the whole six-game series. But the scales had been tipped. And in a subsequent matchup in 1997, Deep Blue triumphed. Humans were no longer winning the battle between man and machine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s a really dangerous business to say, ‘computers will never,’ and then say something after that,” Campbell says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">The Other Reparations Debate: Cuba</title>

    <content xml:base="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/all/2016/01/reparations-in-2016/431487/#note-462222" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A reader writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father is Cuban. He was born very very rich. Fidel Castro took over, and as a result, my father became very poor. One of the reasons we no longer trade with Cuba is because Cuba nationalized property belonging to Americans. My father’s family businesses and properties were seized while my father was still alive. If this were not the case, today I would be a very rich man, being that my father is the eldest male child. Instead, I grew up poor and eligible for food stamps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that our relationship with Cuba is thawing, this nationalization issue has returned. People in Cuba are hurt by our trade embargo, and beginning trade would really help the average Cuban citizen. One of the biggest sticking points is &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt; for seized property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-1220-cuba-reparations-20151221-story.html"&gt;brief overview&lt;/a&gt; of that issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Fidel Castro’s guerrillas swept dictator Fulgencio Batista from power in 1959, the new regime quickly converted the island’s governance to a communist system and nationalized billions of dollars in private property, from small homes and farms to foreign-owned utilities, hotels, sugar cane estates and other corporate assets. Castro settled property claims with England, Spain, Mexico and others, but negotiations with the U.S. ended in 1960 when President John F. Kennedy barred Americans from buying from or selling to Cuba. The embargo came in response to Castro’s seizure of refineries owned by U.S. companies that refused, under Kennedy’s order, to process Soviet oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 5,900 claims with an initial value of $1.9 billion have been certified by the Justice Department’s Foreign Settlement Claims Commission, and estimates put their current value, with interest, at more than $7 billion. Notably, those claims do not include losses by Cubans who later fled to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, the current Castro government is &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2015/0129/Why-Castro-s-demand-for-reparations-from-US-could-backfire-video"&gt;calling for reparations of their own&lt;/a&gt;, demanding from the U.S. compensation for the half-century embargo. Back to our reader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I under no circumstances expect to get paid for the millions my father lost to nationalization. I think logistically this would be nearly impossible to achieve and would end up with grifters getting paid and people with rightful claims being denied. That is why I think getting stuck on this would be very selfish and would hurt people that most need the help.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense it shares a parallel with Ta-Nehisi and his focus on unrealistic &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt; for an aggrieved group rather than focusing on the common good. Slavery r&lt;span class="il"&gt;eparations&lt;/span&gt; have the same difficulties, except the timespan is no longer my father; it is a series of father’s fathers going back more than 150 years. In this time period people have immigrated who appear no different than those that suffered under slavery. There have been generations of people living between them. When I sit here and think whether it would be possible to pay off only the people who were born from former slaves the answer is obviously “no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, some of those children of slaves were also children of slave owners. Should they be paying themselves &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt;? What about people who immigrated after? These questions go on and on with these thorny questions in perpetuity with no clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the next question comes: Who should pay? You cannot identify just the lineage of slave owners and punish them. You will end up taking from everyone to give to some who may or may not deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt; for nationalized property is currently hurting people by preventing normalization of trade with Cuba. The idea of &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt; for slavery is currently preventing the return of racial harmony and a focus on programs that help all without regard to race.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any outcome of slavery &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt; would result in racist ends, as &lt;span class="il"&gt;reparations&lt;/span&gt; would take from all regardless of sin and pay to those regardless of merit. This is due to an inability to actually punish slave owners and reward former slaves due to how long ago this practice was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it would literally be racism. Two wrongs do not make a right. You cannot ameliorate historic persecution with contemporary persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;The main character in &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt;, Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), is the only one who’s named for a real-life Hollywood figure: a notorious “fixer” who bullied movie stars into behaving themselves and kept their dirty secrets out of the press. Throughout the film, the heavily fictionalized Mannix runs into crisis after crisis and ponders whether he should quit the movie business all together. Despite his job title, he doesn’t actually fix many problems—most of them end up being resolved with goofy serendipity in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- START "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/hail-caesar-a-confection-of-old-hollywood/433995/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/hail_caesar_george_clooney_1/lead_960.jpg?1454096249" width="242"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/hail-caesar-a-confection-of-old-hollywood/433995/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt;: A Confection of Old Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;!-- END "MORE ON" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an actress pregnant out of wedlock, is told to secretly give her baby to a studio agent (Jonah Hill) so that she can adopt it back from him in what seems a charitable move; instead, the two fall in love. Mannix is pestered by twin gossip columnists (both Tilda Swinton) who have a story of a star’s sexual shenanigans, but it falls apart when the source is revealed to be a communist. Mannix’s wife even asks him to call his son’s baseball coach because he doesn’t want to play shortstop; later he learns his son took the field without a fuss. “Took care of itself,” Mannix murmurs with satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s one issue he tackles decisively. Near the end of the film, the leading man Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), having been kidnapped by communists for a day, starts ranting about the evils of capitalism and the studio’s complicity in deceiving the working man. Mannix slaps him and tells him to get back to work: “The picture has worth, and you have worth if you serve the picture, and you’re never gonna forget that again.” It’s an ironic note of optimism from the Coens, but optimism nonetheless—a wry celebration of the movie system they’ve become a part of, and one that stands in fascinating contrast to their earlier, surreal Hollywood satire, &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, when &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink &lt;/em&gt;was released, the Coens were still fairly new to the industry. They broke onto the scene with the indie critical hit &lt;em&gt;Blood Simple&lt;/em&gt; in 1984 before making the small-budget &lt;em&gt;Raising Arizona &lt;/em&gt;(1987) and the grander &lt;em&gt;Miller’s Crossing&lt;/em&gt; (1990). The latter, a prohibition-era gangland yarn, frustrated them so much during the scripting process that it inspired &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt;, a film about having writer’s block. As with all their films, the Coens insist &lt;em&gt;Fink &lt;/em&gt;isn’t remotely autobiographical. But even so, it paints a nightmarish picture of 1940s Hollywood as a town where the producers and studio heads are ranting egomaniacs, the writers are drunken, broken-down fools, and the L.A. hotel the action is set in literally resembles hell. The only similarity to &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt;? They’re both about the same fictional company: Capitol Pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink,&lt;/em&gt; the title character (John Turturro) is a playwright looking to bring his work to the masses: a Clifford Odets-type ready to be exploited when he’s put under contract by a major studio. Seeking to connect with the common man as he writes a wrestling movie for Capitol, he stays at a dumpy hotel where the wallpaper is peeling and there’s only one other visible resident, a garrulous man named Charlie Meadows (John Goodman). Meadows eventually turns out to be some sort of personification of the devil himself, a shotgun-wielding lunatic who makes the hallways spontaneously combust with his rage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/02/the-latest-definitive-ranking-of-the-coen-brothers-films/460257/"&gt;my favorite Coen Brothers film&lt;/a&gt;, and one of their most divisive—partly because its deeper meanings are so obscure. It’s very clearly a film about creative frustration, but you could argue Hollywood is also a metaphor for something larger, or that &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt; is a satire of the studio system itself. While staying at the hotel, Fink is repeatedly attacked by a mosquito—his blood is literally being sucked dry, and his creative efforts on his script are rewarded at the end of the film with a dressing-down by the studio chief, who wanted formula and decides to punish Fink by keeping him under contract but publishing none of his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar!&lt;/em&gt; is preoccupied with larger issues too—it’s set in the early ’50s, as the studio system began to falter and lose its stranglehold on big stars. Mannix is a sort of grand mechanic for this sputtering Hollywood machine, walking onto lot after lot to try and solve everything that goes wrong. In the process, he (and the viewers) get to behold one dazzling spectacle after another, from an aquatic musical number fronted by Scarlett&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Johansson, to a Gene Kelly-esque dance sequence from Channing Tatum, to an athletic Western action sequence from Alden Ehrenreich. While &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink &lt;/em&gt;offered only brief, mocking clips of other films about wrestling, &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar! &lt;/em&gt;serves up a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/hail-caesar-a-confection-of-old-hollywood/433995/"&gt;cornucopia of delights&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt;, the hero is enslaved to the studio system, and though his fate is uncertain, he &lt;span&gt;seems to have tapped new creative potential&lt;/span&gt;. The nebbish Fink bears a distant resemblance to the disgruntled screenwriters who kidnap Whitlock in &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar! &lt;/em&gt;and lecture him about the means of production and his diminished value within the capitalist machine. The Coens clearly have sympathy and affection for their fictional writerly brethren, but they’re still as pathetic as the woolly-brained Whitlock (the kidnappers try to donate the ransom to the Soviet Union to advance the “cause”). As in many Coen brothers films, there’s a certain fatalism at work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is not in the message but in the tone. Films like &lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;A Serious Man&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Inside Llewyn Davis&lt;/em&gt; see their protagonists seeking creative fulfillment or asking questions of higher powers—and receiving no answer. In &lt;em&gt;Hail, Caesar! &lt;/em&gt;the answer is given, and it’s as hopeful as one could expect from the Coens: Cinema’s somber, weighty moments matter, but equally crucial are the frivolous, joyful bits of entertainment—watching Channing Tatum tap-dance on a table, or George Clooney ramble overwritten monologues. It bears repeating, one last time: The picture has worth.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;cite&gt;John Minchillo / AP&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The first politician punished for the poisoning of Flint, Michigan, was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayne_Walling"&gt;Dayne Walling&lt;/a&gt;, the 42-year-old Democratic mayor who lost reelection in November by fewer than 2,000 votes. When he dug into the numbers, Walling discovered what he considers the source of his demise: 3,000 new voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a predominately African American city, 3,000 Flint residents who did not vote for the nation’s first black president in 2008 or 2012 cast ballots in last year’s mayoral election. What motivated them? The water &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/352795/how-government-this-columnist-failed-michigan-city"&gt;crisis&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but Walling offers another explanation—one deeply embedded in the American body politic and yet related to the lead poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Angry, frustrated citizens raised their voice,” he said. “Trump-type voters came out of the woodwork.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="primary-categorization"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walling put his finger on the biggest story of the 2016 campaign: the rowdy machinations of voters long frustrated by the political establishment and newly cognizant of their powers to disrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 21st-century populism threatens the old order of politics at every level, from an oft-neglected corner of Michigan to the celebrity state of New Hampshire, where Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump crushed status-quo candidates on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ad331e9e1a054251902f7c532344a7e7/exit-polls-new-hampshire-gop-voters-feel-betrayed-party"&gt;Exit polls&lt;/a&gt; from the first primary of the 2016 cycle suggest that four of 10 voters were self-identified independents. Sanders took 72 percent of such voters in the Democratic primary, while Trump captured 35 percent—both pulling more than twice as much support as their rivals from voters who felt betrayed by their parties and were dissatisfied or angry with the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Republican primary voters said what they were looking most for in a candidate was somebody who “tells it like it is.” Donald Trump earned two-thirds of their votes. Half of GOP voters said they wanted to back an outsider, and one-third said they were looking for a candidate who would change the political system. Those voters swarmed to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third of Democratic voters valued honesty, more than said they wanted a candidate with experience, one who cares about people like them, or who preferred someone who could win the general election. &lt;a&gt;Ninety-one percent &lt;/a&gt;of voters looking for political integrity chose Sanders over Hillary Clinton, an icon of the Democratic establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their many differences, populist voters backing both Trump and Sanders want some of the same things: America pulling back from rest of the world to focus on domestic concerns; reducing special deals for the rich; reversing violations of the public’s privacy by the government and big business; fighting corporate welfare; and curbing big banks and other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Trump and Sanders are disrupting the way political campaigns are run. Sanders is raising millions of dollars in small donations, rejecting the Big Money and Dark Money that finance Washington. Trump has spent relatively little on television ads, withholding money from the consultant class while his message courses through social media and the ratings- and click-obsessed media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump abandoned the time-honored practice of sucking up to local reporters and the political elite. He opted to nationalize the campaign, jetting home most nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win or lose, their campaigns suggest that politics and government are finally starting to experience the disruption experienced by almost every other social institution, transforming how people work, shop, play, and even raise their kids in the post-Internet era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is scary for most people, and there’s a lot of it right now: decades of economic downturn and transition; the greatest technological surge since the industrial era; a demographic makeover that will soon render white Americans a minority; and 15 years of war against a metastasizing enemy. Through it all, American leaders and institutions are failing to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so voters are asking, “Which side of the barricade are you on?” As Doug Sosnik, a Democratic strategist who co-authored &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applebees-America-Successful-Political-Religious/dp/0743287193"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; with me about leadership, &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/which-side-of-the-barricade-are-you-on-100302#ixzz3zlxaHylN"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; in 2013: “Is it the side of the out-of-touch political class that clings to the status quo by protecting those at the top and their own political agendas, or is it the side that is fighting for the kind of change that will make the government work for the people—all the people?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump and Sanders positioned themselves on the side of the people, and won New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vast majority of Americans believe their country is on the wrong track, they can’t trust any social institution, and they can’t trust one another. Most believe Democratic and Republican leaders care more about themselves than their country. The percentage of self-identified independents is steadily growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forced to choose between two parts of a duopoly, many voters reluctantly side against the most-loathed option, a trend that political scientists call &lt;a href="https://politicalwire.com/2015/06/04/the-rise-of-negative-partisanship/"&gt;negative partisanship. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is bigger than either Trump or Sanders. Unless the political system undergoes major structural reform and is injected with leadership that is transparent, honest, and capable of solving major problems together, the public will continue to demand change. They will grow accustomed to forcing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here in Flint and everywhere,” Walling told me, “voters are finding new and creative ways to say, ‘Enough!’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Trump or Sanders win and fail to produce change, the anger will boil hotter. Should they lose and the establishment claims victory, the anger may boil over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you found it unsettling to watch a reality-TV star and socialist win New Hampshire in 2016, consider how much worse things could become after a few more years of discontent and disconnection. The status quo cannot hold.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;figcaption&gt;Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister &lt;cite&gt;Christophe Ena / AP&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Allies of the U.S. role in the Syrian Civil War are criticizing Washington’s approach, even as Russian airstrikes continue to bombard the city of Aleppo in support of President Bashar Assad, who remains firmly in office nearly five years after the fighting began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticism of the U.S. came from Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who is leaving his post to head the country’s constitutional court, as well as Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. France and Turkey, along with the U.S., oppose Assad’s regime and support some of the rebel groups fighting the Syrian president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are the ambiguities including among the actors of the coalition. ... I’m not going to repeat what I’ve said before about the main pilot of the coalition,” &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-fabius-idUSL8N15P2IM"&gt;Fabius said in Paris&lt;/a&gt;. “But we don’t have the feeling that there is a very strong commitment that is there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabius has advocated—and President Francois Hollande had supported—a more muscular French foreign policy, including backing Assad’s ouster. He was a critic of the U.S. failure to oust the Syrian leader after the use of chemical weapons despite President Obama’s previous warnings the use of such weapons would constitute a “red line.” Fabius on Wednesday said he didn’t expect the U.S. to change its policy anytime soon—despite pressure on it to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t think that the end of Mr Obama’s mandate will push him to act as much as his minister (John Kerry) declares,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His comments came as Syrian forces, backed by Russian warplanes, continued to bomb the rebel-held city of Aleppo. The military offensive has prompted tens of thousands of people to seek refuge at the Turkish border. Turkey, which is already the largest recipient of Syrians fleeing the civil war, is reeling from the numbers it is hosting, and is tending to those fleeing Aleppo on the Syrian side of the border—a decision for which it has been criticized by the UN and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrian civil war pits Assad against a coalition of rebel groups ranging in politics from moderate to Islamist. Assad is backed by Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group, who are working to keep him in power. Some of the rebels are backed by the U.S. and its allies, including Turkey. Their stated goal is a Syria without Assad. Both sides are, meanwhile, fighting ISIS, which controls territory across the Syria-Iraq border, and is now making inroads in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2016/02/warwithinawar/edf9bae4d.jpg" width="630"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But diplomatic efforts to bring the various factions together&lt;a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-talks-idINKCN0VJ0YS"&gt; have been stymied&lt;/a&gt; by the campaign in Aleppo, and t&lt;span style="line-height: 1.66667;"&gt;he battle against ISIS now appears to be atop Washington’s list of priorities in the region. To this end, the U.S. has enlisted a number of groups to fight against the Sunni militant organization. Among these the most effective have been Kurdish fighters—both in Iraq and Syria. Some of these fighters belong to Syria’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.66667;"&gt;Democratic Union Party (PYD). PYD has close ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which operates in Turkey, and which Ankara views as a terrorist group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In remarks in Ankara on Wednesday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, lambasted the U.S. support for PYD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are you on our side or the side of the terrorist PYD and PKK organization?” &lt;a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_erdogan-slams-us-for-support-for-syrian-pyd_411924.html"&gt;he asked at a speech to provincial officials&lt;/a&gt;. He said Washington’s policies had turned the region into a “sea of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey fears that gains made by the PYD fighters on the Syrian side of the border will embolden its own restive Kurdish population. Washington maintains it does not view PYD as a terrorist group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other coalition news, Canada said this week it would &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-canada-idUSKCN0VH1KB"&gt;stop its airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on February 22 &lt;/a&gt;in line with a campaign promise made by then-candidate Justin Trudeau, who is now the prime minister. Canada contributed six planes to the effort. The government will, however, keep two surveillance planes in the region and increase effort to train Kurdish troops in northern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
