Financial stocks are down by 19% in America. The declines have been even steeper elsewhere. Japanese banks’ shares have plunged by 36% since January 1st; Italian banks’ by 31% and Greek banks’ by a horrifying 60% (see chart). The fall in the overall European banking index of 24% has brought it close to the lows it plumbed in the summer of 2012, when the euro zone seemed on the verge of disintegration until Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), promised to do “whatever it takes” to save it.</p><p><div class="content-image-float-290 retina-290"><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2016/02/articles/body/20160213_fnc405_0.png" alt="" title=""  width="580" height="670" /></div></p><p>The distress in Europe encompasses big banks as well as smaller ones.

Like Tinder, but for economists.&nbsp;Your correspondent is very excited by this idea. The world of dating is rife with inefficiency—and we all know how economists hate inefficiency. Apps that reduce congestion in the dating market by filtering out princes-not-so-charming have huge value—just look at JSwipe, which matches Jewish couples, or&nbsp;<a href="http://glutenfreesingles.com/" target="_blank">glutenfreesingles.com</a>, which...just guess.</p><p>But before I get as carried away as a game theorist with two newly caught prisoners, a quick reality check is in order. For a dating app to work, the market for singletons must be "thick" enough. It must establish a network large enough to benefit from "network externalities", where all the single economists flock to where the other single economists are. Just think of Amazon and eBay—buyers want to be where there are lots of sellers, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To generate such a thick market, economists have to want to date other economists.

 <title><![CDATA[Building more houses is only part of the remedy for high prices]]></title>
 <link>http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/02/can-we-fix-it?fsrc=rss</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>I WANT to hammer home a point that we made in a <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21688352-building-more-houses-only-part-remedy-high-prices-unlocking-britains-16m-empty">piece</a> a few weeks ago. Whenever economists talk about the British housing market (which by some measures is the world's most expensive except Monaco) they will have a simple solution to bubbly prices: build more houses. The logic is impeccable: there is high demand for housing, but not enough supply. That leads to high house prices. Increase the supply of housing, and prices will fall. Simple.</p><p>This explains why successive governments have had a housebuilding target of around 200,000-250,000 a year (in the last decade Britain has built on average about 160,000 houses a year).&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I think economists' obsession with building new houses misses the point. For one, it's not immediately obvious that Britain is suffering from woefully inadequate undersupply of housing, at least at the national level. In the EU there are on average <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Average_household_size,_2014_(average_number_of_persons_in_private_households).png">2.3 people per private house</a>, the same figure as found in Britain.&nbsp;</p><p>If overall supply is not a problem, then what is?

About 15 minutes after Daallo Airlines Flight 159 departed from Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, an explosive device carried by Abdullahi Abdisalam Borleh, one of the passengers, blew a gaping hole just above the right wing of the plane (a spot identified in al-Qaeda literature as being the most effective place to detonate a bomb). Mr Borleh, who is suspected of being a suicide bomber, was sucked out of the aircraft and fell to his death. Everyone else survived. Had the incident occurred minutes later, once the plane reached cruising altitude, the resultant explosive decompression would almost certainly have killed all aboard. To say that the 73 innocent passengers on Flight 159 had a lucky escape is an understatement.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Last October, the 224 souls aboard Metrojet Flight 9268 were not so fortunate.

They were portrayed in cave paintings thousands of years ago. Others are just lifting off. The racing of drones is, thus far, a niche activity, but several firms are betting on it. “Every person under the age of 13 either has a drone or wants one,” says Nick Horbaczewski of the Drone Racing League (DRL), a startup. “We are going to raise a generation of pilots.” The DRL has raised $8m from investors, including Stephen Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, an American-football team, and CAA, a big agency that represents film and sports stars.</p><p>Drone-racing began as an amateur sport in Australia only a couple of years ago, and spread with the aid of social media, as pilots shared videos of their contests. Racers navigate at speeds of up to 100mph (160kph) through a course of illuminated checkpoints, getting a drone’s-eye view of their aircraft’s position through video goggles.</p><p></p><p>The sport has had to work out some technological kinks, such as eliminating the “latency” that delays the live video feed to the pilot, which could cause a drone to miss a turn and...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21692774-if-video-games-can-be-spectator-sport-why-not-racing-drones-turning-drone-races?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

Adults happily ditch one camp for the other as soon as they begin a family, seemingly losing all sense of comradeship with former allies.&nbsp;This writer remembers cursing screaming children on flights before he had them himself. Now the sound of a child's crying on take-off elicits feelings of sympathy rather than irritation.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>Nowhere are the dividing lines deeper, it seems, than in Germany.

Bank shares have been falling fast, particularly those in Europe, which in morning trading, were <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-stocks-idUKKCN0VH0JZ">down 22% so far </a>this year. The collapse of 2007 and 2008 was all about the banking sector. If European banks are in trouble, then comparisons with that period are bound to mount; earlier worries, notably the slowdown in Chinese growth and the fall in commodity prices, had more <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2016/01/markets">parallels with the Asian crisis of 1997-98</a>.</p><p>A number of factors are hurting bank shares. First, the sluggish performance of European economies over several years means there are worries about bad debts on bank balance sheets; Heartwood Investment Management reckons that 16.7% of Italian bank loans are non-performing, against a European average of 5.6%. Italian banks have been amongst the hardest hit.

Its buildings are guarded by lions cast in bronze which passers-by touch for luck. HSBC has never been bailed out, nationalised or bought, a claim no other mega-bank can make.

While its peers took emergency loans from central banks in the crisis of 2008-10, HSBC, long on cash, supplied liquidity to the financial system.</p><p>Yet behind that invincible aura lurks an insecurity: where is home? When Western and Indian merchants founded the bank in Asia in 1865, they considered basing it in Shanghai before settling on Hong Kong. Faced with wars, revolutions and the threat of nationalisation, the bank has chosen or been compelled to move its headquarters, or debated it, in 1941, 1946, 1981, 1986, 1990, 1993, 2008 and 2009.</p><p></p><p>HSBC believes its itinerancy explains its survival.
