      <title>Universities told to raise numbers of working-class and black students</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/11/universities-told-to-raise-numbers-of-working-class-and-black-students</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jo Johnson tells universities to increase access to higher education among poorer white boys and cut dropout rates among black students&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has imposed new rules on universities requiring them to work more closely with schools in poorer areas, targeting white working-class boys in particular in a bid to get them into higher education, the Guardian can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the prime minister’s ferocious &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/31/university-of-oxford-rebuts-camerons-claims-over-student-diversity"&gt;criticism of levels of inclusion and diversity in universities&lt;/a&gt;, the government has issued fresh guidance to the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/oct/15/highereducation.accesstouniversity2"&gt;Office for Fair Access (Offa)&lt;/a&gt; demanding that universities do more to boost social mobility and raise aspirations among disadvantaged groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/11/universities-told-to-raise-numbers-of-working-class-and-black-students"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Universities must reach out to the poorest in society – for everybody’s sake | Jo Johnson</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/11/universities-action-reach-out-poorest-jo-johnson</link>
      <description>If universities broaden their intake, it won’t be just the individuals involved who benefit. The government is helping them do just that&lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/31/university-of-oxford-rebuts-camerons-claims-over-student-diversity" title=""&gt;prime minister gathered university leaders at Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; as part of a move to break down the barriers blocking under-represented young people from going to university. Now, we are taking action – publishing the first new guidance on fair access in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/dec/15/university-funding-crush-poor-grant"&gt;A university funding system designed to&amp;nbsp;crush the aspirations of the poor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/11/universities-action-reach-out-poorest-jo-johnson"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Average university boss's salary rises 14% in five years</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/11/average-uk-university-boss-vice-chancellor-salary-rises-272000</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Union report says average rise for vice-chancellors last year alone was 3%, to £272,000, but 27 heads enjoyed increases of more than 10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay for university bosses has soared by 14% over the last five years, with the average vice-chancellor’s salary now just under &amp;pound;275,000, according to a new report. The highest single earner was &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/21/new-york-university-president-andrew-hamilton"&gt;Andrew Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, until recently the vice-chancellor at Oxford University, who was paid &amp;pound;462,000 for the academic year 2014-15, states the report, published on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Salford spent &amp;pound;516,000 on vice-chancellors’ pay for two incumbents in 2014-15, according to the document. Meanwhile, the average pay rise for vice-chancellors last year was an inflation-busting 3%, though 27 university heads enjoyed a pay increase of more than 10%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/11/average-uk-university-boss-vice-chancellor-salary-rises-272000"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nicola Sturgeon announces £23m to help disadvantaged students enter medicine in Scotland</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/nicola-sturgeon-fund-students-poor-backgrounds-medicine-scotland</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;50 more places at medical schools for those from deprived areas and ‘entry level’ programmes among measures planned over five years by first minister&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicola Sturgeon is to spend &amp;pound;23m on boosting the number of students from poor backgrounds at Scottish medical schools after a study found they were dominated by attendees from the most affluent homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first minister’s initiative draws heavily on data disclosed by the Guardian that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/22/medical-school-students-wealthy-backgrounds"&gt;only 4.3% of students&lt;/a&gt; at Scotland’s five medical schools came from the poorest 20% of postcodes, with Scottish students more likely to be from private schools or with parents from elite professions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/nicola-sturgeon-fund-students-poor-backgrounds-medicine-scotland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I wish I weren't the only girl in my computer science class</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2016/feb/10/im-the-only-girl-in-my-computer-science-class</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m determined to do well in a traditionally male area, and I think more girls should consider doing Stem subjects&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you a sixth-form student with something to get off your chest? &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2013/sep/23/blogging-students-how-to-pitch-and-blog"&gt;Here’s how to blog for us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 17, and I’m the only girl in my computer science class. I’m pretty much the same as my classmates, only shorter. I expected a large majority of my classmates to be male, but being the only girl is slightly mind-blowing. I also study engineering, and am hugely outnumbered in that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People think it’s unusual for me to study a subject that is associated with boys and leads to what is generally considered a man’s job. Stem subjects are still male dominated: nearly &lt;a href="http://www.wes.org.uk/statistics"&gt;four out of five&lt;/a&gt; of those who took A-level physics in 2012 were male. And &lt;a href="http://www.wes.org.uk/statistics"&gt;only about half&lt;/a&gt; of female Stem graduates go on to work in Stem roles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2016/feb/10/im-the-only-girl-in-my-computer-science-class"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Britain’s comprehensive schools are being wiped out. Here’s how it’s being done | Lola Okolosie</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/britain-comprehensive-schools-wiped-out-academies</link>
      <description>It’s an odd way to conduct education policy – promoting academies and starving schools of funds. But what’s really worrying is how powerless parents are in the process&lt;p&gt;“Academies raise standards”, or so we have been told. As Melissa Benn and Janet Downs write in their excellent book &lt;a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-truth-about-our-schools/melissa-benn/janet-downs/9781138937178" title=""&gt;The Truth About Our Schools&lt;/a&gt;, this is a myth that has “taken on the force of a quasi-biblical truth in public life”. Announced often, its utterance alone has become the basis of its validity. This is an odd way to conduct educational policy. Facts should really speak for themselves, but this doesn’t seem to be the case where academies are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/05/massively-improved-state-schools-threaten-private-sector"&gt;'Massively' improved state schools threaten private sector&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/britain-comprehensive-schools-wiped-out-academies"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What kind of law firm should I apply to?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/what-kind-of-law-firm-should-i-apply-to</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;No two law firms are the same, so before you apply for a job, make sure you understand the different kinds of employers you could approach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring lawyer, understanding the differences between the various types of law firms is essential when applying for training contracts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most UK firms fit into the following few broad categories: high street (smaller firms serving a predominantly private client base in a local area); regional/national (larger multi-office firms serving a city or counties, often with a London office); City (based in the City of London, with a strong brand and international presence, often with a steer towards corporate work); and niche firms (which focus on a specialist area of law, for example, intellectual property).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/11/what-kind-of-law-firm-should-i-apply-to"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A moment that changed me: being made head girl | Lemara Lindsay-Prince</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/11/moment-changed-me-being-made-head-girl</link>
      <description>At school I was a troublemaker. Then two of my teachers made a shocking suggestion – and I learned that a person need not be defined by their past&lt;p&gt;At certain times in my life my parents remind me that I wasn’t meant to be here. I know that sounds like I was some kind of mistake, but what they really mean is that some people had written me off at certain stages in my life, and there were many cliched discussions about the wrong choices I was making. Everything I’ve accomplished is a reminder of how far I’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was born to West Indian parents, and it was instilled into me that I would have to work twice as hard to get half as much. That education wasn’t a joke – it was the only way to make it. But there I was in secondary school, taking the mick, thinking it was better to be recognised by a group of girls older than me than by my peers – and most definitely than by my teachers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/11/moment-changed-me-being-made-head-girl"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The secret diary of a student nurse: 'I'm asked to look after a patient who has been violent'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/11/the-secret-diary-of-a-student-nurse-im-asked-to-look-after-a-patient-who-has-been-violent</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A student nurse says her ward is constantly understaffed, putting extra strain on nurses and healthcare assistants as they try to deal with difficult and distressed patients &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My week begins with a 12-hour shift. I arrive and the nurses’ station is worryingly empty. Not once have we been fully staffed in the past few weeks and the pressure of an impending inspection by the Care Quality Commission, the healthcare regulator, is growing. I start by helping patients with their breakfast, as the night staff did not have time. The food – porridge and bread – looks disgusting. No wonder they prefer to eat the chocolates and sweets their families bring. I am relied upon greatly to help with personal care needs, despite being a supernumerary. My frantic mentor is doing three nurses’ jobs while hoping to avoid a drug error. &lt;br tabindex="-1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/11/the-secret-diary-of-a-student-nurse-im-asked-to-look-after-a-patient-who-has-been-violent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>GPS, construction  and video games – everyday uses for Pythagoras’s theorem</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/feb/10/gps-construction-and-video-games-everyday-uses-for-pythagorass-theorem</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lily Allen wonders if anyone still needs to be taught a bit of ancient Greek geometry. Well, for a start, without it there would be no digital music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Allen gave a voice to bored schoolchildren everywhere this week when she &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12148849/Minister-slaps-down-Lily-Allen-after-she-questions-the-value-of-children-learning-Pythagorass-theorem.html"&gt;posted on Twitter to moan about Pythagoras’s theorem&lt;/a&gt;. “I left school 15 years ago and I’ve not used Pythagoras’s theorem once or even seen a Bunsen burner,” she complained. But before the back rows of maths classes across the country start cheering, she suggested some even more boring lessons. “Are they teaching children about how mortgages work, national insurance or how to fill out a self-assessment tax return yet?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education minister Nick Gibb quickly stepped in to admonish Allen. “Not everyone’s lucky enough to have a job like yours,” he sniffed. “For many people maths and science are crucial to their career &amp;amp; life chances.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2016/feb/10/gps-construction-and-video-games-everyday-uses-for-pythagorass-theorem"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The teacher recruitment crisis: views from the frontline</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/10/the-teacher-recruitment-crisis-views-from-the-frontline</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a new report reveals the extent of the shortage facing the teaching profession, we ask our community about the impact it is having on their classrooms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/teachers-are-leaving-as-government-falls-short-on-recruitment-nao-finds"&gt;National Audit Office (NAO) has laid bare the extent of the recruitment and retention crisis in teaching&lt;/a&gt;. The number of teachers leaving the profession has increased by 11% over three years and ministers have failed to hit their recruitment target for four consecutive years (despite a &amp;pound;700m annual bill for their efforts). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NAO report, &lt;a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/report/training-new-teachers/"&gt;Training New Teachers&lt;/a&gt;, revealed some stark realities about the impact of the crisis. For example, more secondary school classes are now being taught by teachers without a relevant post-A-level qualification in their subject – particularly in physics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/10/the-teacher-recruitment-crisis-views-from-the-frontline"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Number of teachers leaving the profession has risen 11% over three years, NAO says, and recruitment targets have been missed for past four years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of teachers leaving the profession has increased by 11% over three years as the government continues to fall short of recruitment targets, Whitehall’s independent spending watchdog has found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite spending &amp;pound;700m every year on training, ministers have failed to reach their own goals for recruitment for four consecutive years, according to the National Audit Office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/teachers-are-leaving-as-government-falls-short-on-recruitment-nao-finds"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Harris academies boss’s salary nudges £400k after latest pay rise</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/harris-academy-salary-chief-executive-daniel-moynihan-schools</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our diary:&lt;/strong&gt; Is Sir Daniel Moynihan the world’s highest-paid school leader? Plus: Harris pupils go awol; Sunderland school closure shocks students; pay progression – only for some&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does England have one of the world’s best-paid leaders of schools in the form of Sir Daniel Moynihan, chief executive of the Harris academies chain? The&amp;nbsp;question arises after the Harris Federation’s annual accounts revealed another pay rise for Moynihan in 2014‑15, with his salary climbing by 5%, or &amp;pound;20,000, to &amp;pound;395,000-&amp;pound;400,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moynihan also received pensions contributions from his employer of &amp;pound;40,000-&amp;pound;45,000, a slight drop on the &amp;pound;50,000-&amp;pound;55,000 paid in 2013-14. His salary, which is now approaching three times that of the prime minister, has risen by 83% since 2009. Moynihan’s position is akin to a local authority director of education and so as far as we are aware his salary in that position is unmatched in the UK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/harris-academy-salary-chief-executive-daniel-moynihan-schools"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, warns government Prevent strategy may stifle free speech and university research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s anti-terrorism laws aimed at universities risk having a “chilling effect” on academic debate and a “deadening impact” on research, according to a former director of public prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Macdonald, &lt;a href="https://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/people/warden/m/ken-macdonald"&gt;warden of Wadham College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, said while it was fair to ask universities to curb attempts to radicalise or recruit students, the government’s anti-radicalisation strategy, Prevent, could be abused to stifle otherwise legal debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/07/anti-terror-laws-academic-debate-oxford-college-ken-macdonald-prevent-strategy-university"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Better behaviour and results are attracting families who can afford private school fees, says Good Schools Guide editor&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State schools have improved “massively”, according to the founder of the Good Schools Guide, who says their growing popularity with parents is threatening to drive weaker private schools out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralph Lucas, editor-in-chief of the guide regarded as the &lt;a href="https://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/"&gt;bible for middle-class school choice&lt;/a&gt;, said that as results and behaviour improved even those families who could afford private school fees were increasingly choosing the state sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/05/massively-improved-state-schools-threaten-private-sector"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I knew nursing was what I had to do – my bursary made it possible</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/feb/10/nursing-student-bursaries-shortage-nhs</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Axing student bursaries will make it harder to address the nursing shortage in the NHS and patient care will suffer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nursing is a profession I had always considered but it took me a long time to take the decision to finally apply. I had my doubts, part of me wondered if I really wanted it enough to make all the sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four years ago all that changed. My dad was found dead at home and at the same time my granny was in a hospice receiving palliative care. She didn’t have long and I had to say goodbye earlier than I thought I would. I will never forget the nurse who smiled as I walked in, understood and hugged me as I cried on her shoulder. For a few minutes, I didn’t have to be strong, because she let me have some time to just be. From then on I knew nursing was what I had to do. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/feb/10/nursing-student-bursaries-shortage-nhs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I'm protesting alongside healthcare students to save the NHS</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/why-im-protesting-alongside-healthcare-students-to-save-the-nhs</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We should all rally behind the healthcare students battling to save NHS student bursaries – everyone’s future is at stake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2016 autumn spending review, the government announced plans to scrap the NHS student bursary and replace it with tuition fees, landing future nurses with &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/nhs/12018994/Nurses-and-midwives-could-face-65000-debts-under-loans-plans.html"&gt;&amp;pound;65,000 worth of debt&lt;/a&gt;. Healthcare students &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/08/student-nurses-march-nhs-bursary-campaign"&gt;point out&lt;/a&gt; that this would mean students end up effectively paying to work for the NHS on their placements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These funding cuts being driven through by the Tories start from a totally incorrect assumption: that education only benefits the individual, and therefore the individual should bear the cost. But nowhere is it clearer than in the case of student nurses, that education benefits everyone in society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/why-im-protesting-alongside-healthcare-students-to-save-the-nhs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Valerie Amos: the coolest of cool to handle Soas’s hot potato</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/valerie-amos-soas-london-university-director</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new Soas director and first female black head of a UK university has a lifetime of achievement and diplomacy to draw on. In these troubled times, she may need it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/gallery/2016/feb/09/one-hundred-years-of-soas-in-pictures"&gt;100 years of Soas in pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curious thing about Valerie Amos is most people have never heard of her and those who have can’t quite put their finger on what she’s done. In fact, her achievements are staggering. When she became international development secretary in 2003, she was the first British cabinet minister from an African-Caribbean background. Now, newly installed at age 61 as director of London University’s School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/18/valerie-amos-black-university-professors"&gt;she is the first black woman to head a UK university&lt;/a&gt;. She has been leader of the House of Lords, high commissioner to Australia and, despite being a Labour life peer, was recommended by David Cameron for a top &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/valerie-amos-un-humanitarian-affairs"&gt;UN post as undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She ought, you feel, to be an inspiration for young black Britons and a prominent spokesperson for their hopes, fears and frustrations. It is not her style, however, to seek the limelight or play to the gallery. She is a doer, not a publicist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/valerie-amos-soas-london-university-director"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'Now is the time to step up': students urge others to register and vote</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/08/now-is-the-time-to-step-up-students-urge-others-to-register-and-vote</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following news that changes to the electoral register will disenfranchise thousands of students, young people urge their peers to fight back&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students are warning their peers that they are in danger of losing their votes because of changes the government has made to how voters are registered. An estimated 800,000 people &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/31/electoral-register-loses-estimated-800000-people-since-changes-to-system"&gt;have dropped off the electoral register&lt;/a&gt; since the government introduced changes to the system – and students are at the biggest risk of being disenfranchised. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new system, individual electoral registration (IER), universities cannot block register students in halls of residence. “The transition has resulted in a significant fall in the number of people on the electoral register in areas with a university,” says Gloria De Piero, the shadow minister for electoral registration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/08/now-is-the-time-to-step-up-students-urge-others-to-register-and-vote"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cameron wants diversity in universities? Sort out the school syllabus first</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/08/cameron-wants-diversity-in-universities-sort-out-the-school-syllabus-first</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The move away from creative subjects in schools makes a mockery of the prime minister’s plans to get more disadvantaged pupils into higher education&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were shades of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/27/oxford-elitism-laura-spence"&gt;Laura Spence affair&lt;/a&gt; in David Cameron’s recent swipes about &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/31/university-of-oxford-rebuts-camerons-claims-over-student-diversity"&gt;diversity at the University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, Gordon Brown’s intervention in the case of a state school pupil with 5 As rejected by Oxford ushered in a golden era of government policy to widen participation in higher education. No such luck this time. Government policy has started to reverse access to parts of the sector – almost certainly by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/may/29/study-arts-humanites-enrichment"&gt;Let's stop being defensive about the value of arts degrees&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/08/cameron-wants-diversity-in-universities-sort-out-the-school-syllabus-first"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Media studies: why does the subject get such a bad press?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/08/media-studies-bad-press-alevel-soft-option</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 10th most popular course at A-level is having a revamp, with supporters hoping it will shake off its ‘soft option’ image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Last summer there was a moment when there were concerns that media studies might be deleted,” says David Buckingham, an expert on children and technology and professor at Loughborough University, who spent much of last year fighting for the subject’s future in English schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment passed: new specifications for media and film studies qualifications were &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?departments[]=department-for-education**"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt;. But will the updated content, combined with our media-saturated lives, swing more support behind media education for 14 to 18-year-olds, and reverse a decline that has seen numbers taking media GCSE fall from a high of almost 70,000 in 2008 to 50,000 in 2014, while the number of students training to be media teachers on the only specialist PGCE is just 13?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/08/media-studies-bad-press-alevel-soft-option"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Six questions to ask before choosing your A-levels</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/03/how-to-decide-which-a-levels-to-take</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the first big decisions that students make – so how do you figure out what A-levels to take? And are there any that you should avoid?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking your A-level subjects is one of the first big academic decisions that students face. Choosing what to study won’t just determine what you’re doing in year 12 and 13, it could also affect your university choices and even your future career. And it’s not just a case of picking between subject areas – you’ll need to decide what type of qualifications you want to sit and whether it’s best for you to do them at school or a college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what options are available to year 11 students? And how can you weigh up which subjects best suit your ambitions? We spoke to university admissions tutors to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/03/how-to-decide-which-a-levels-to-take"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Criminalised’ as a failing school – in the midst of Oxford’s wealthy spires</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/failing-school-oxford-property-prices-recruit-teachers</link>
      <description>Rose Hill was once the most improved school in the country. But high property prices mean it has struggled to recruit staff and now Ofsted has judged  it inadequate. Its headteacher talks to Sally Weale&lt;p&gt;There can be no easy way to receive the news that your school is being put into special measures. Last week Sue Vermes, headteacher at Rose Hill primary school in the south-east corner of Oxford, found herself in exactly that position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/14231675.Rose_Hill_Primary_School_placed_in_special_measures_following_Ofsted_inspection/" title=""&gt;Oxford Mail&lt;/a&gt; described the report by the schools watchdog, &lt;a href="http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/123049" title=""&gt;Ofsted&lt;/a&gt;, as “scathing”. It detailed a string of failures: that staff training on how to prevent radicalism and extremism was not completed; there were issues around safeguarding, declining academic standards, uninspiring teaching, low expectations and low attendance. A school that a few years ago had been named the most improved in the country had slipped from “good”, to “requires improvement” and finally to the lowest category of “inadequate”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/failing-school-oxford-property-prices-recruit-teachers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I went back to my old school to say: I’m gay</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/school-gay-come-out-lgbt-teenager</link>
      <description>Tim Ramsey never dared come out at his all-boys grammar while a pupil. Now he’s looking for volunteers to reassure other LGBT teenagers they are not alone&lt;p&gt;I pretty much knew I was gay by the time I started secondary school - perhaps knowing all of S Club 7’s lyrics aged 11 was a giveaway, but I didn’t want to admit it to myself. When I eventually did, I decided it was better not to tell anyone. At my all-boys northern grammar, being gay felt like something negative, a bit rubbish and best to hide. I was terrified my friends wouldn’t want to be my friends any more. I was convinced they might think that I fancied them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew how I was meant to be. I should play rugby, like football, hang around town after school with girls from the other local school, smuggle in a copy of FHM and talk about sex. But I didn’t. I was useless at sport and played a “gay instrument”, the flute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/school-gay-come-out-lgbt-teenager"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Dear Nicky Morgan: It’s too easy to say grammar schools were good | Michael Rosen</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/nicky-morgan-grammar-schools-secondary-selection</link>
      <description>Some schools seem to be sneakily selecting their pupils. We don’t want a return to the era when life patterns for many were laid down at age 10 … do we?&lt;p&gt;For several years, we parents in England have been regaled with the news that the secondary school system is being rejigged for our children’s benefit. With a comprehensive secondary system, overseen by local authorities, your predecessors told us we had no “choice”. Now we have an exciting array of local authority schools, academies, and free schools on offer. We can shop around finding the school that will suit our child or our outlook. And that’s fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was at school, we were told that fairness came through the 11-plus exam – a combination of a verbal-reasoning test, and tests in English and arithmetic. Before our last year at primary school, we were streamed. All the children in the B stream were told they wouldn’t pass and half the children in the A stream were told that they wouldn’t either. Every week we did tests, which were averaged, and at the end of the week we moved places in the classroom to sit ranked in order of our test scores. Our teacher stood in the middle of the A-stream class and reminded us: “All of you this side of the room will pass, all&amp;nbsp;of you on this side will fail.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/nicky-morgan-grammar-schools-secondary-selection"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Oxford students’ fight to topple Cecil Rhodes statue was the easy option | Peter Scott</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/students-cecil-rhodes-statue-campaign-oxford-oriel-college</link>
      <description>Rhodes has been dead 100 years. Students should instead campaign for fair access to universities or against tuition fees&lt;p&gt;Oriel College, Oxford, has decided to keep its statue of Cecil Rhodes, despite the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/19/rhodes-fall-oxford-university-inclusivity-black-students"&gt;Rhodes Must Fall&lt;/a&gt; campaign, a protest that has been one of a kind on this side of the Atlantic. Such campaigns are increasingly common in the US. Yale is facing &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/the-cause-to-rename-calhoun-college/408682/"&gt;demands&lt;/a&gt; for one of its colleges to be renamed, because John Calhoun, a pre-civil war southern politician, was a supporter of states’ rights and slavery. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/23/princeton-woodrow-wilson-racism-students-remove-name"&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt; is facing demands for the renaming of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, because the former president (of the university as well as the US) shared then commonplace views that now would be considered racist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of such campaigns in the UK is probably less a result of reticence or deference on the part of the students here than the fact that historically few British universities have benefited from philanthropy on the scale of the Cecil Rhodes bequest. However, we are playing catch-up as fast as we can, so there is now a good supply of dubious benefactors to whom students will be able to object in the (near?) future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/02/students-cecil-rhodes-statue-campaign-oxford-oriel-college"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Long hours, endless admin and angry parents – why schools just can’t get the teachers</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/01/schools-teachers-classroom-crisis-stress-grind</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;British schools are reporting a classroom crisis, with thousands of disaffected teachers leaving the profession, and new graduates discouraged from training because of the daily stress and grind. And with the number of state school pupils set to rise by a million by 2022, the problem is only getting worse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacquie Sainsbury left secondary school in Canvey Island, Essex around 30 years ago with one O-level. She had five kids before deciding to train as a teacher. In 2000, she left Derby University with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE), and nine years later, she became the head of Brookhill Leys primary school in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. I meet her there on a Monday afternoon: she and her deputy show me round before we sit down in her office and unpick exactly what it takes to make a success of a 430-pupil school in what she describes as “a very tough area”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eastwood sits in the heart of what used to be the Nottinghamshire coalfield. The last pit here closed in 1985, and the scars have yet to heal. “We’re in the bottom 20% of the deprivation indicators in the country,” Sainsbury tells me. “A lot of poverty.” She and her staff have to cope with regular challenges. “It’s not unusual for our teachers to be shouted at by parents; to have to deal with drunk parents,” she says. “The things that our staff have to deal with, you don’t have to deal with in an everyday walk of life. We’ve got fantastic parents, and we’ve got parents who need a lot of help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/01/schools-teachers-classroom-crisis-stress-grind"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to force metrics to take feelings into account</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/10/how-to-force-metrics-to-take-feelings-into-account</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plagued by higher education’s obsession with metrics, university staff are moving towards quantifying the emotional business of alumni relations &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How we use metrics in higher education is a fiercely debated topic , and as the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/02/teaching-excellence-framework-university-tef-student-data-higher-education"&gt;Teaching Excellence Framework is rolled out,&lt;/a&gt; looks set to stay high on the agenda. Yet academics are not the only ones facing an increased emphasis on measurement. Over the last few years administrative staff have also felt the pain of the numbers game. But there’s been very little debate about how the shift to a data-driven culture is affecting us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the emphasis on metrics mean for people who work in alumni relations? Online tools such as Google Analytics, for example, have been used to check web statistics for quite a while. But workplaces are constantly evolving, putting staff under pressure to generate more and more data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/10/how-to-force-metrics-to-take-feelings-into-account"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the School of Oriental and African Studies celebrates its 100th year, we look back at a century of life on its campus. From preserving knowledge of disappearing languages to developing radical economic theories, the school is famous for changing prevailing views of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Share your memories of Soas in the comments below... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/gallery/2016/feb/09/one-hundred-years-of-soas-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Campus security: 'We heard a scream and saw him running up the road naked'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/06/university-campus-security-guard-scream-sprinting-nude</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Universities face a constant battle to keep students safe – from bike thieves, burglars and heavy breathers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At 5pm we get the switchboard,” said the man inducting me on to the night shift. If I’d heard right, his name was Trifle. “Anyone can phone up, so you’ve got to keep it polite. Lecturers, press, overseas placement students wanting to know their exam time…” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a light on the desk. “There you go,” said Trifle. “Your first call.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/06/university-campus-security-guard-scream-sprinting-nude"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I'm not LMAO at ridiculous emails from my students</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/05/im-not-lmao-at-ridiculous-emails-from-my-students</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Convoluted excuses and drunken declarations of love can be amusing, but I’m genuinely concerned about young people’s communication skills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hiya *smiley face*! Sorry I’m not there!! I was in bed with my boyf and he got some hand cream in his eye so I took him to hospital but the car broke down and we had to wait for the green flag man and got chatting with him before we went to a‘n’e but were&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; here now and boyf is fine lol!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an email from one of my students explaining why she wasn’t at a lecture. Unfortunately, it’s not unusual for me to receive messages like this. It’s as if my students don’t understand the difference between formal communication and social media; as if chattiness and cheek will make up for the fact that they’re missing class for the sixth week in a row; as if they don’t realise that the more detailed the excuse, the more unbelievable it sounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/05/im-not-lmao-at-ridiculous-emails-from-my-students"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Racism in universities: 'There is a sense your face doesn't fit'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/04/racism-in-universities-there-is-a-sense-your-face-doesnt-fit</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research shines a light on the insidious racism that blights higher education in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covert racism and discrimination persist in the UK’s colleges and universities, according to new film, Witness, commissioned by the University and College Union (UCU). The project, initiated by the UCU Black Members’ Standing Committee, chronicles the experiences of the union’s black members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/19/how-much-does-your-university-do-for-racial-equality"&gt;How much does your university do for racial equality?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/04/racism-in-universities-there-is-a-sense-your-face-doesnt-fit"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How social media can help universities in times of tragedy</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/03/how-social-media-can-help-universities-in-times-of-tragedy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many institutions shy away from online forums in a crisis. But social media can prevent confusion and create space to mourn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tragedies can strike campuses without warning. In a single moment, the “it-can’t-happen-here” illusion is shattered. At times like this, social media is an essential tool for emergency communication, but it can also be more than that. When a student dies, Facebook and Twitter can unite a community, yet many higher education institutions shy away from engaging in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2014, I learned that a student had died at my alma mater. I visited the college website and social channels in search of information, but there was nothing. As an alumna, I felt left in the dark and disconnected from a community about which I care deeply. As a communications professional, I found the lack of acknowledgement equally troubling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/03/how-social-media-can-help-universities-in-times-of-tragedy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Q: What did universities learn from the financial crash? A: Nothing</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/02/q-what-did-universities-learn-from-the-financial-crash-a-nothing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most finance education is morally bankrupt. We must stop peddling dangerous lies to our students &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global financial crash of 2008 led to bailouts that are still being borne by ordinary people all over the world through higher taxes, higher property prices and lower savings rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/sep/09/dont-let-the-market-dominate-the-debate-on-university-teaching"&gt;Don't let 'the market' dominate the debate on university teaching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/02/q-what-did-universities-learn-from-the-financial-crash-a-nothing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>My PhD could save an endangered species with time-travelling mud</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/01/phd-save-endangered-species-common-scoter-bird-mud</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a bug person in a bird person’s world, but my work might just solve the mystery of the disappearing common scoter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I talk about my PhD, I usually end with the proviso: “But I’m not really a bird person.” Most people look confused at this point, as I’ve just described my research aim of understanding the decline of one Britain’s rarest breeding birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if I’m not a bird person, what am I? In the years before my PhD I would have described myself as a freshwater entomologist, a bug person to my friends. My first roles in research involved looking at what my colleagues termed “bird food” and I insisted on calling “insect communities” (I was a bug person in a bird person’s world). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/feb/01/phd-save-endangered-species-common-scoter-bird-mud"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>On board: how universities are leading the way for female leadership</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/31/on-board-how-universities-are-leading-the-way-for-female-leadership</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Higher education is moving in the right direction on gender equality, with more than a third of board positions held by women. So what have we learned so far?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher education is making steady progress when it comes to gender equality on its boards; recent analysis found that &lt;a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/governance-gender-balance/"&gt;32% of board members in the sector are female&lt;/a&gt;, compared with just &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/all-time-high-uk-women-boardroom-members"&gt;23.5% of those in FTSE 100 companies&lt;/a&gt;. The Higher Education Funding Council for England wants the figure to reach 40% in English universities by 2020, and the Scottish Funding Council has laid out plans to hit the same level by 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;Related: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/nov/23/why-we-need-quotas-for-women-on-boards"&gt;Why we need quotas for women on boards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/31/on-board-how-universities-are-leading-the-way-for-female-leadership"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teacher Adam Schoenbart gives his students an hour a week to pursue a topic that interests them – and it has transformed their engagement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half a century ago, a scientist called Art Fry added a little glue to the back of a piece of paper – and created the Post-it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fry made this stationary staple at the science and technology company 3M during “15% time” – a scheme that allowed employees to spend 15% of their time pursuing their own ideas rather than simply completing tasks set by managers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/09/bring-googles-20-time-to-your-classroom-with-passion-based-learning"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to teach ... Valentine’s Day</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/08/how-to-teach-valentines-day</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From exploring the medieval roots of the celebration to love-laced language exercises – our lesson resources will help teachers turn Cupid into a learning opportunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, we know that Valentine’s Day is rubbish. Any magic the annual love-in has is rooted in its power to turn vast piles of cash into glitter, red satin and heart-shaped paraphernalia. And yet when a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/8510091.stm"&gt;school in Weston-super-Mare tried to ban Valentine’s Day cards, there was uproar&lt;/a&gt;. You need to face up to it: Valentine’s Day is probably going to happen in your school. So how can you ensure that Cupid’s arrows aren’t too much of a pain?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/08/how-to-teach-valentines-day"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/07/four-scientific-ways-teachers-can-cope-with-stress</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From basic mediation exercises to learning to say ‘no’, there are many simple changes teachers can make to improve their physical and mental health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressures of teaching can be difficult to manage and it can sometimes feel like you have no time to switch off. So if you ended last year feeling overwhelmed and anxious then the start of the new year is a good time to make some changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But learning to cope better with stress does not happen overnight and takes some effort on your part. Here is a list of some simple, scientifically-proven practices to help you unwind and improve your mental health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/07/four-scientific-ways-teachers-can-cope-with-stress"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Secret teacher: we're not to blame for poor social mobility</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/06/secret-teacher-blame-poor-social-mobility</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for government to say teachers fail to inspire children raised in poverty – it’s cheaper than fixing the awful conditions they experience outside the school gates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Sunday evening and I felt a failure. I know what you’re thinking – “not another whinging teacher!” – but hear me out. It wasn’t the pile of unmarked books in the hallway, or the data left un-analysed because I had watched The Voice instead. It was because of “Cake Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cake Monday is a well-meaning initiative that was established to give us some joy at the end of a day’s work. Each week we take it in turns to bake, and meet in the staffroom before our evening meetings to scoff a slice of Victoria sponge or Mr Mason’s (mum’s) cheesecake. It’s a lovely idea – until it is your turn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/06/secret-teacher-blame-poor-social-mobility"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Confessions of a tutor to the super-rich: they aren't faceless symbols of injustice any more</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/04/confessions-tutor-super-rich-arent-faceless-symbols-injustice</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Children of the super-rich are often too stressed and distracted to engage in lessons. Seeing their lives has made me realise there are no winners with wealth inequality &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am reading about cars with my teenage tutee. Although the article is difficult and English is not his first language, he gets the gist: cars are pollution-generating status symbols. “That reminds me!” he says, grabbing his phone and chatting loudly to someone in Arabic. “I told my driver to fix my Land Ranger.” It’s fine though, he says, he has eight cars. I feign being unfazed by this; it’s my first experience of tutoring the super-rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was employed through an agency to teach English to Salman* and, while rather disengaged, he was chatty and we got on well. It’s a long way from where my teaching career began in an inner city state school with a bad Ofsted rating. Like Salman, many of my pupils there were immigrants – the difference being, most were living in poverty: while Salman worries about his SUV, my former students are preoccupied by having no money for heating and worn out shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/04/confessions-tutor-super-rich-arent-faceless-symbols-injustice"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/03/five-easy-ways-urban-schools-can-experiment-with-outdoor-learning</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Outdoor learning isn’t just the preserve of rural schools. These simple ideas will help you incorporate outdoor learning in a concrete jungle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s hunting for minibeasts in the playing fields or reading a book under a tree, the &lt;a href="http://www.outdoor-learning.org/Default.aspx?tabid=213" rel="nofollow"&gt;positive impact of outdoor learning on young people’s achievement and development&lt;/a&gt; is widely acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what do you do if your school isn’t blessed with acres of green space? From making the most of your playground to venturing further afield, we’ve gathered five tips to help urban schools feel the benefits of taking learning outside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/03/five-easy-ways-urban-schools-can-experiment-with-outdoor-learning"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'It’s all about democracy': inside gender neutral schools in Sweden</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/02/swedish-schools-gender-alien-concept</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At five preschools in Stockholm, the idea that ‘boys will be boys’ and ‘girls will be girls’ is being challenged – with interesting results&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At five preschools in Stockholm you won’t find the usual designated areas for dressing up, building blocks, toy cars and dolls houses. All the toys are purposefully jumbled up together as part of a gender-neutral policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept began in 1998 when an amendment to &lt;a href="https://sweden.se/society/education-in-sweden/"&gt;Sweden’s Education Act&lt;/a&gt; stipulated that all schools must work against gender stereotyping. As a result, Lotta Rajalin, the head of five state preschools for children aged one to six, introduced gender-neutral policies in her preschools. In 2011 she opened &lt;a href="http://www.sodermalmsforskolor.se/egalia/extern/in-english.htm"&gt;Egalia&lt;/a&gt; (equality in Latin), a school that specialises in gender equal teaching – an approach that does not assume that different genders have different characteristics, wants and needs. “It’s all about democracy,” says Rajalin. “We want to give all children the same opportunities the same rights.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/02/swedish-schools-gender-alien-concept"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to teach ... Chinese year of the monkey</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/01/how-to-teach-chinese-year-of-the-monkey</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From exploring our simian relations to creating Chinese art and learning Mandarin, here’s our guide to teaching this festival&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a rat? A tiger? Maybe you’re a dragon? Don’t worry, we’re not talking about your staff room persona – although we can all probably think of a snake or two – but rather the signs of the Chinese zodiac. The Chinese lunar new year and the beginning of the year of the monkey starts on 8 February. It’s a time of celebration and new beginnings, and a great way to introduce your students to another culture. So how best to bring a bit of monkey business to your classes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/01/how-to-teach-chinese-year-of-the-monkey"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stem subject snobbery: a student’s view on why arts subjects matter</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jan/31/career-arts-gcse-dance-stop-the-stem-subject-snobbery</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This 16-year-old says taking GCSE dance was the best decision she ever made – why is everyone so negative about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Y’know, the soft subjects,” says the boy in maths. “The easy ones: the stupid girls in bottom set take them. Extra, pointless GCSEs. Like dance. It shouldn’t even be a subject.” We’re choosing subjects for our A-level taster day at school, and for some, the prospect of choosing an “arty” option is hilarious. I see the raised eyebrows when I explain two of my GCSE options are dance and drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 16, I am constantly baffled by people who believe they can define what is of academic value. People see me as an equation – because I am academic, I should not choose dance and drama at GCSE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jan/31/career-arts-gcse-dance-stop-the-stem-subject-snobbery"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ofsted’s veil threats won’t help schools | Letters</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/27/ofsted-veil-threats-wont-help-schools</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it’s official: Ofsted publicly announces that it uses ratings as a weapon and a threat, with its leader Michael Wilshaw warning school leaders that they risk their school being judged inadequate for the one transgression against his opinion of allowing the full veil to be worn by staff and pupils (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/26/schools-inspector-issues-veil-warning" title=""&gt;Ofsted to get tough on schools that allow girls to wear full veil&lt;/a&gt;, 27 January).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single issue of this kind then, whatever that may be, ignores and damns all else which happens in the complex fabric of an educational establishment. The achievements of pupils and staff alike are discounted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/27/ofsted-veil-threats-wont-help-schools"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Attacks on educational institutions are on the rise and the motives are varied – from undermining the state to stalling education&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/20/bacha-khan-university-explosions-heard-as-gunmen-attack-pakistan"&gt;Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead at Bacha Khan University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 13 months there has been a series of extremely bloody attacks on schools, colleges and universities. On Wednesday Taliban suicide bombers &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/20/bacha-khan-university-explosions-heard-as-gunmen-attack-pakistan"&gt;mounted an assault &lt;/a&gt;in north-western Pakistan; just over a year ago the same movement attacked a school only 30 miles away,&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/19/peshawar-school-massacre-pakistans-911"&gt;killing 150 people, most of them children&lt;/a&gt;. In April last year &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/07/kenyan-families-mourn-best-brightest-garissa-attack"&gt;147 were killed in a massacre at a university&lt;/a&gt; in northern Kenya by the Somalia-based al-Shabaab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of other incidents of violence directed at educational institutions, teachers or students across the world which have not been reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/20/why-are-terrorists-targeting-schools-and-universities"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Myanmar pro-democracy leader says libraries are rare in schools and children read less due to increasing technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi, who was forced to spend years of solitude under house arrest, has hit out at young people “wasting time” on computer games and social networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The veteran opposition politician, whose party will soon take power after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-wins-myanmar-landmark-election"&gt;winning a landmark election&lt;/a&gt; in Myanmar last November, made the comments in a letter to organisers of a literary festival at the weekend in Yangon. “Our lifestyles are changing nowadays as technology improves,” she wrote to the Nobel-Myanmar literary festival posted online on Saturday. “Now our children waste a lot of their time on computer games, internet games and social networks. Children read less because the use of technology has increased.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/17/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar-children-computer-games-libraries-schools"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ankara accused of violating academic freedom by detaining 27 signatories of petition calling for end to ‘massacre’ of Kurdish people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey has been accused of violating academic freedom by rounding up university teachers who signed a petition denouncing military operations against Kurds in the south-east of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police detained 27 academics over alleged “terror propaganda” after they signed a petition together with more than 1,400 others &lt;a draggable="true" href="http://bianet.org/english/human-rights/170978-academics-we-will-not-be-a-party-to-this-crime"&gt;calling for an end to Turkey’s “deliberate massacre and deportation of Kurdish people”&lt;/a&gt;. The US ambassador to Turkey condemned the crackdown as “chilling”.

      <title>Gendered titles are pointless and divisive | Letters</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/03/gendered-titles-are-pointless-and-divisive</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the day that Maria Miller MP refreshingly calls for &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/02/call-to-remove-gender-from-uk-passports-and-driving-licences" title=""&gt;no gender markers on official documents&lt;/a&gt;, Ian Sparling (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/01/some-new-year-resolutions-for-the-guardian" title=""&gt;Letters&lt;/a&gt;, 2 January) claims that “a straightforward Ms or Mr is adequate to describe people”. No, it isn’t. It is superfluous and perpetuates the labelling of people according to a patriarchal system of two&amp;nbsp;unequal classes. Titles such as master, mistress, lord, lady, sir and madam were historically intended to maintain class distinctions. So I’m not holding my breath to see them swept away in the current political climate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maz Simon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stockport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Re Stuart Heritage’s article on “co-sleeping” with his baby son (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/02/i-have-a-secret-to-confess-about-my-parenting-skills" title=""&gt;Man with a pram&lt;/a&gt;, Family, 2 January), if a person you sleep with hits you in the face repeatedly or on the head, I think it’s an indication that you should stop doing it and that maybe they think so too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Fletcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;St Ives, Cornwall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/03/gendered-titles-are-pointless-and-divisive"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After PM calls for legislation to throw light on admissions of black and poorer applicants, Oxford says it does not see need &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Britain’s elite universities defended its record on diversity on Sunday as the government said it should “shine a spotlight” on its admissions decisions for ethnic minority and disadvantaged students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the weekend, David Cameron accused the University of Oxford – where he studied as an undergraduate – of “not doing enough to attract talent from across our country”, and noted that Oxford accepted just 27 black British students in a single year. The prime minister vowed to create new laws to shame elite universities into improving diversity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/31/university-of-oxford-rebuts-camerons-claims-over-student-diversity"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Dear Ms Morgan: your guidance on reading is a mini-syllabus on how to wreck poetry for children | Michael Rosen</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/07/key-stage-1-poetry-assessment-wrecks-poems-for-children</link>
      <description>You cannot prescribe and measure children’s reaction to a poem, or confine it to exact or correct meanings&lt;p&gt;Along with many other poets, I receive many invites to go into schools to share my poetry with pupils, to talk about how and why we write and read poems. I’ve been doing this since 1974. We think it’s a good idea because teachers, children and poets value poetry. If you put a group of poets, teachers, pupils and parents in a room to talk about why we do this, we come up with a wide range of answers. Here are some I’ve collected: it’s a good way to open up conversations about our lives, experiences and feelings; poetry often uses the sound of words to express feelings without actually saying what those feelings are; it’s a good way to express “big ideas in small spaces”; suggest things without necessarily coming to a conclusion; express a single moment without necessarily relating the consequences; play with language without it having to be literal; confess things about our lives; soap-box about our beliefs; express identity and culture; and, because it “borrows” voices from a wide range of sources (including poetry itself), it has an infectious quality that enables many of us to imitate it, parody it, learn it and play with it. We are able to do all this without any direction from on high. We just do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What messages about poetry does this guidance give? That we read a poem in order to “retrieve” exact information from it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/07/key-stage-1-poetry-assessment-wrecks-poems-for-children"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Laurence Lerner obituary</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/laurence-lerner-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father, Laurence Lerner, known as Larry, who has died aged 90, was an academic and writer. The name of his 1999 autobiography, Wandering Professor, describes his life aptly. He taught variously in Africa, America and around Europe. At Queen’s University Belfast, one of his students was a young Seamus Heaney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, my father published nine volumes of poetry, including Selves (1969); a series of poems inspired by the Bible called Chapter and Verse (1984); The Man I Killed (1980); and his final volume, Rembrandt’s Mirror (1987), in which he imagines the painter making a late self-portrait. He also wrote three novels and numerous books of literary criticism as well as many articles and much-loved, lighthearted poems for his family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/laurence-lerner-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>School admissions – the dodgy practices need to stop</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/schools-admissions-dodgy-practices-ofsted</link>
      <description>Hundreds more schools control their own admissions, and there is too much temptation to admit only the easiest pupils to teach&lt;p&gt;The past six months has seen a rash of stories about schools placing undue pressure on parents to make &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34129659" title=""&gt;financial contributions&lt;/a&gt;. It is a tricky issue. As funding cuts bite, schools will inevitably turn to their local communities to make up the shortfall, but that will lead to more inequality between schools in the worst- and better-off areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also easy to see how this would deter some parents from applying to certain schools, especially if, as was the case with a &lt;a href="http://schoolsweek.co.uk/exclusive-gove-and-pm-school-made-forbidden-donation-request/" title=""&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; attended by the children of the prime minister, David Cameron, and the last education secretary, Michael Gove, the request for money was linked to the admissions process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/schools-admissions-dodgy-practices-ofsted"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>University heads' salaries averaged more than £250,000 last academic year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father, John Tobias, who has died aged 93, was a teacher who discovered his vocation while training RAF pilots during the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John was born in Plumstead, south-east London, to Hilda and Ernest Tobias. Ernest had been a professional flautist and violinist who later worked as a senior manager in a mining company. John was educated at Cardinal Vaughan school, in Kensington, where he excelled academically and in sport.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/john-tobias-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What's the point of school uniform?</title>

      <description>You might hate your school uniform, but I think it's there for good reason, says 15-year-old Chloe Spencer&lt;p&gt;A shirt, tie and blazer may not be the ingredients for my favourite outfit, but if I were given the choice, I wouldn't throw away the idea of school uniform. Wearing a uniform is a badge of pride, creates an identity for a school and is an important part of being a school student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Uniforms show that you are part of an organisation. Wearing it says we're all in this together,&amp;quot; Jason Wing, head teacher at the Neale-Wade academy in Cambridgeshire, says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2013/oct/03/why-wear-school-uniform"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Clegg, my friend and colleague, who has died aged 67 from cancer, was professor of organisational psychology at Leeds Business School. As well as making significant contributions within his core discipline, he worked across disciplinary boundaries, conducting and publishing research with colleagues in engineering, medicine and computer science. He was dedicated to research of real-world value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Leeds he was also director of research of the management division, director of the Centre for Socio-Technical Systems Design, and director of the Rolls-Royce University Technology Partnership for Design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/10/chris-clegg-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is your oyster if you’re a physics polymath (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/04/maths-and-physics-not-just-for-the-ultra-bright" title=""&gt;Letters&lt;/a&gt;, 5&amp;nbsp;February). Integrating physics and maths in cross-curriculum education for all opens up a whole world of possibilities. My&amp;nbsp;daughter’s choice of A-levels – physics, geography and English literature, especially including an in-depth study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner – was spot on for her career as an officer in the merchant navy. Now she calculates velocities and sets vectors as she navigates over sunken plate tectonic boundaries while writing poems about sonar-spotted deep sea mounts below inspired by celestial night-time constellations observed overhead. A&amp;nbsp;physics-inclusive education that leads her all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosalind Todhunter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northwich, Cheshire&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join the debate – email &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;guardian.letters@theguardian.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/how-physics-makes-the-world-your-oyster"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Let’s hope the justice ministry teaches Gove to regret killing Mockingbird</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/gove-regret-to-kill-a-mockingbird-schools-teaching</link>
      <description>The novel tells a moral tale that in today’s divided and unequal world teenagers need to study more than ever&lt;p&gt;I vividly remember my first encounter with &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/16/robert-mccrum-100-best-novels-harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird" title=""&gt;Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/a&gt;. As a teenager, bored one day in Bolton library, I picked the novel from the shelves and was entranced by its immediacy, and its strangeness. I loved its acutely observed depiction of southern American manners – of ladies “who bathed before noon … and by nightfall were like soft tea-cakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum”. And I fell for its hero, Atticus Finch – who was &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/04/to-kill-a-mockingbird-atticus-finch-voted-most-inspiring-character-harper-lee-hobbit-hunger-games" title=""&gt;last week voted&lt;/a&gt; the most inspiring character in literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, as a young English teacher taking her first O-level class, I found this&amp;nbsp;book a sure-fire standby to capture –&amp;nbsp;and hold – a class of 15-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/09/gove-regret-to-kill-a-mockingbird-schools-teaching"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Karin Slaughter: Libraries saved me, now they need rescuing</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/08/libraries-saved-me-now-they-need-rescuing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Books provide access to a better way of life, and for many, libraries are the only way they can get to them. That is why I am campaigning to save them and you should, too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father and his eight siblings grew up in the kind of poverty that Americans don’t like to talk about unless a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina strikes, and then the conversation only lasts as long as the news cycle. His family squatted in shacks. The children scavenged for food. They put cardboard over empty windowpanes so the cold wouldn’t kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books did not exist here. When you grow up starving, you cannot point with pride to a book you’ve just spent six hours reading. Picking cotton, sewing flour bags into clothes — those were the skills my father grew up appreciating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/08/libraries-saved-me-now-they-need-rescuing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The murder of my friend Giulio Regeni in Egypt was an attack on academic freedom | Neil Pyper</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/06/murder-giulio-regeni-egypt-academic-freedom-students</link>
      <description>Students or anyone else conducting research in dangerous places should be better protected by their university – and their government&lt;p&gt;The body of Giulio Regeni was &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/italian-student-found-dead-egypt-giulio-regeni-torture"&gt;discovered in a ditch in Cairo on 2 February&lt;/a&gt;, showing evidence of torture and of a slow, horrific death. Giulio was studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge, and was &lt;a href="http://ilmanifesto.info/in-egypt-second-life-for-independent-trade-unions/"&gt;carrying out research&lt;/a&gt; on the formation of independent trade unions in post-Mubarak Egypt. There is little doubt that his work would have been extremely important in his field, and he had a career ahead of him as an important scholar of the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giulio, originally from Fiumicello in north-east Italy, had a strong international background and outlook. As a teenager, he won a scholarship that allowed him to spend two formative years studying at the &lt;a href="http://www.uwc-usa.org/"&gt;United World College&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico. He was especially passionate about Egypt. Before beginning his doctoral research, he spent time in Cairo working for the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (&lt;a href="http://www.unido.org/en/unido-united-nations-industrial-development-organization.html"&gt;Unido&lt;/a&gt;). At the age of 28, he stood out with his big hopes and dreams, and he was committed to pursuing a career that would allow him to make an impact on the world, which is a poorer place for his passing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/06/murder-giulio-regeni-egypt-academic-freedom-students"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
