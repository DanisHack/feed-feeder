			<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Why can’t Hillary Clinton’s campaign get going? By most conventional measures, she had a pretty good week in New Hampshire: a commanding performance in Thursday night’s debate, an emotive one in Wednesday night’s televised town hall. But the scale of her loss to Bernie Sanders was striking, and its <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/new-hampshire-primaries-exit-polls/">shape</a> was revealing. Clinton lost among young voters by nearly 6–1, and among independents by 3–1. Most arrestingly, Sanders won voters with an income of less than fifty thousand dollars by 2–1. There’s a lot of talk about Clinton’s campaign repeating the chaos and errors of 2008, but that year she had the white working-class vote. Clinton’s candidacy looks narrower than ever, more confined to those whose experience of life approximates her own. Last night, in New Hampshire, the rare demographic group she won was those with incomes of more than two hundred thousand dollars a year. For now, at least, Clinton has become the wine-track candidate.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Throughout his twenties, Kevin Castille sold crack cocaine on the streets of the Truman neighborhood in Lafayette, Louisiana, where his grandparents and aunts had raised him and eight other children, who slept in their modest family home three to a bed. He&#8217;d been the smallest, quietest one. He still was. But dealing brought money—some ten thousand dollars a week, throughout the nineteen-nineties, in profits. He bought fancy clothes and cars, including a string of seven Ford Mustangs. He didn&#8217;t use drugs—or even drink alcohol—but he was &#8220;getting high from the cash,&#8221; he told me a couple of years ago, for a <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/masters/kevin-castille-the-unlikely-making-of-americas-top-masters-runner" target="_blank">Runner&#8217;s World profile</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Throughout his twenties, Kevin Castille sold crack cocaine on the streets of the Truman neighborhood in Lafayette, Louisiana, where his grandparents and aunts had raised him and eight other children, who slept in their modest family home three to a bed. He&#8217;d been the smallest, quietest one. He still was. But dealing brought money—some ten thousand dollars a week, throughout the nineteen-nineties, in profits. He bought fancy clothes and cars, including a string of seven Ford Mustangs. He didn&#8217;t use drugs—or even drink alcohol—but he was &#8220;getting high from the cash,&#8221; he told me a couple of years ago, for a <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/masters/kevin-castille-the-unlikely-making-of-americas-top-masters-runner" target="_blank">Runner&#8217;s World profile</a>.

Nearly half of all Indonesian females under the age of twelve have undergone female genital mutilation or cutting, as it’s formally known.

They know my life’s work,&#8221; Hillary Clinton said on Thursday night, at the Democratic Presidential debate in Durham, New Hampshire, as an exchange with Senator Bernie Sanders grew steadily more tense. First they had argued about whether it was proper to call Clinton a progressive, or whether, as Clinton said, Sanders, with his list of progressive positions, covering his opposition to everything from the death penalty (which Clinton supports) to super PACs (she has one), had made himself “the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism.” She added, “I don&#8217;t know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard-fighting progressives in the Democratic Party.&#8221; The not-so-implicit charge, that Sanders talked himself up and talked down to the people who actually did the work—especially to a person named Clinton—was a response that she deployed throughout the debate. She variously called Sanders&#8217;s critical positions &#8220;amusing,&#8221; &#8220;unfair,&#8221; and a &#8220;smear.” Sometimes, that tactic was effective; her defense of her progressiveness made for a strong opening.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">The Broadway musical, to the distress of those of us who think of it as America’s own fine form, the thing we made first and still, Andrew Lloyd Webber be damned, make best, isn’t really pop culture anymore. It’s always too expensive, often too Disneyfied, mostly too strangely specialized a taste. But on rare occasions the American musical can still be central to what we should call our ceremonial culture. A song-and-dance show on Forty-sixth Street can occasionally touch so profoundly on some central preoccupation of a period that, even if relatively few of us actually get to see it live, it still becomes a kind of hearth at the center of a national celebration. Cast albums and downloads put the songs in every earbud, as LPs once put them on every basement hi-fi. Only five or six musicals over the past fifty-plus years have become true ceremonial phenomena of this kind: “South Pacific”; “My Fair Lady”; in another way after J.F.K.’s death, “Camelot”; “A Chorus Line”; “West Side Story”; and maybe “Fiddler on the Roof”—but it has certainly happened again with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s astonishing “Hamilton.”</p>]]></description>

But its size and geographic reach is limited.” That left Rubio as “the only candidate who can plausibly unify the party.” Writing for National Review Online, David French touted the Florida senator for similar reasons, reminding restive Republicans that “winning a general election means uniting every G.O.P. constituency under one banner, and happily so.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">Even warm Januaries are winter, and for people who enjoy basketball, nothing in recent memory has brightened the long season like the rise of the irresistible Golden State Warriors. This is partly due to their diminutive long-range shooting guard, Stephen Curry, a human trebuchet who leads the N.B.A. in both scoring and charisma. But the defending N.B.A. champions are the sport’s best and most entertaining team not because of a single player but because they have an intricate approach to basketball that’s as pleasing to old-school coaching purists as it is to people fitted out in new blue-and-gold Curry shirts—he’s first in the league in jersey sales, too—who simply can’t get enough of watching the little guy throw the rock over a mountain and into the cup.</p>]]></description>

It turned out that he was badly understating things. Age moved like a cleaver through the Democratic caucuses in Iowa last night, dividing voters into camps.

Abruptly, the intensity of the attachment between Sanders and young Americans has become an axis on which the campaign tilts, as it has on the affection between Donald Trump and working-class whites.

But then Trump began calling him &#8220;the Canadian&#8221; (Cruz was born in Calgary, to an American mother) and wondering why &#8220;nobody likes Ted&#8221; (party leaders, especially those who have worked with Cruz, seem to despise him). He then pulled ahead in the polls. If Trump had triumphed, and then gone on to win in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada—he is leading in the polls in all three states—Republicans might have just told themselves that a deal-maker was better than a nobody, which is what the other candidates were looking like, and slapped some gold paint on the establishment.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="descender">The Republican primaries are beginning! Whom to root for? If you are a conservative, your decision is likely settled. If you are a liberal—and, in particular, part of the stubborn liberal remnant that pays attention to newspaper endorsements—a candidate has recently been suggested to you: John Kasich, the moderate governor of Ohio, and perhaps his Party’s last defender of the banner of bipartisanship.

The editorial boards themselves did not seem all that excited by their choice. Kasich is the foremost member of the race’s “sanity bracket,” the Globe said, a bit petulantly.
