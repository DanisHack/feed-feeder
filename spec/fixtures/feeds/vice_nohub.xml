</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>Vic Armstrong doubling for Harrison Ford in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' (All images courtesy of Vic Armstrong)</em>
</p><p>The film is <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>. Indy's dad (Sean Connery) has been taken by the Nazis and is imprisoned in the "belly of the steel beast" (a tank). Luckily, Indy (Harrison Ford) has a horse. Riding through a desert canyon, he chases the tank down, his ancient skills more than a match for the fascist machinery. He draws up alongside the tank, leaps from his horse, executes a perfect landing, beats some Germans up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGDSAs_uU4" target="_blank">saves the day</a> (eventually).
</p><p>"There's a lot more that goes into stunts than people generally imagine," says Vic Armstrong. "It's not just jumping off a horse."
</p><p>Armstrong is a stunt co-ordinator, stunt double and director with five decades of experience in film. He's won a Technical Achievement Academy Award and is, according to Guinness World Records, the most prolific stuntman of all time. He's talking me through one of his most famous stunt sequences, which he both performed as Harrison Ford's stunt double and helped conceive as the film's stunt co-ordinator.
</p><p>A stunt of this complexity begins with the storyboard. In Los Angeles, a month before the shoot, the director Steven Spielberg maps out the chase with his team. Then the task is flipped over to Armstrong and action unit director Micky Moore, who have to make the sketches a reality. They pick the locations. This one is "tricky, in that you had to have the tank going along at a fairly close proximity to a cliff face", says Armstrong. Shooting in Almeria, Spain, in a part of the desert now known as Indiana Jones Canyon, Armstrong knew that the sandy soil was good for the horse, because it wouldn't have been able to gallop on rocks, but that the crumbly soil could easily give way, meaning that Armstrong couldn't ride too close to the edge of the cliff.
</p><p>They brought a bulldozer in to cut an eight to ten-foot vertical cliff face and installed a ramp for the horse to run down, above the tank. Mechanical rigs are buried in the ground, along with pads to land on. Then Armstrong works with the horse, Huracan, who he knows well. Rehearsals take place at Fort Bravo, the local film studios synonymous with the Western. The horse's speed needs to be consistent and matched to the tank so that when Armstrong stands up to make the jump, the horse doesn't duck out sideways or slow down. "In the studios, we have the manure heap, which is the softest place to land and the biggest area to allow for mistakes. So I'd do the jump from the horse onto the manure heap and measure any discrepancies between the rehearsal and the real situation."
</p><p>Armstrong has to make sure he makes his jump on the horse's up-stride. He has to ride on a rhythm: on two, he's up on the horse with his feet on some concealed pegs that will help him spring off, on three he starts kicking off and, on four, he's in the air. When he does it for the first time on camera he's a split second out, and because all his energy has been absorbed he looks like "Tom and Jerry running through the air". But then he nails it, landing on a "half-inch little pad" on the tank, wearing some padding himself. "I was so fucking pleased to land I didn't care whether it hurt or not."

</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>Vic shooting for the 1974 film 'Dead Cert'</em>
</p><p>Born in Buckinghamshire, Vic Armstrong grew up riding horses. "My dad was a racehorse trainer, and all I ever wanted to do was race steeplechasers," he tells me. "I rode my first racehorse on the Gallops when I was nine. When I was 14, I started to race, but I was quite big and had to starve myself to get to 11 stone 7, so I only ever stayed as an amateur jockey."
</p><p>Richard Todd, a post-war star of stage and screen, owned some horses that Armstrong's father trained. "He used to come and watch his horses gallop on the weekend. I was eight or nine and I'd watch him with his open top Bentley and glamorous women," remembers Armstrong. "He'd tell me about the films he was in and I would watch them, then go home and pretend I was him. I'd be Rob Roy galloping up the glens, throwing myself off my pony – sad life, really, playing on my own! But I loved it."
</p><p>That fantasy element is key to the stunt business, though. "It's basically playing cowboys and Indians," Armstrong says of his profession. "You know you can't do something for real, so you do it for the movies."
</p><p>This play-acting is allied to physical strength and practical ability. "Growing up with horses made me very practical because you have to do the thinking for something," says Armstrong, "and at the same time you have to adapt your thinking for the animal and be totally responsible."
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/10/vic-armstrong-stunt-man-indiana-jones-body-image-1455131478.jpeg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="854" data-original-height="1036" data-model-id="144588" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="vic-armstrong-stunt-man-indiana-jones-body-image-1455131478.jpeg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>Arnie presenting Vic with his lifetime achievement award at the Taurus Awards, the stunt world equivalent of the Oscars</em>
</p><p>Armstrong's journey into the film business began when he met a guy called Jimmy Lodge, who was one of the top horse stuntmen of the day. Lodge came and rode horses at the racing stables Armstrong's father ran. He was working on a film called <em>Arabesque</em>, with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren, and he needed a horse from the stables. Then he needed someone to ride that horse. Armstrong stepped up and, for his troubles, was paid "the princely sum of £20 a day, which was over a week's wages in those days".
</p><p>Pretty soon, the young would-be jockey realised that rather than simply subsidising his horse racing, doing stunts could be a business. "There very few stunt people – certainly no young ones in those days, in 1965," he says.
</p><p>Young, good with horses and able to learn skills like sword fighting, high work (doing stuff at great heights) and falling ("You're so focused that everything becomes very slow, it seems to take forever to get down... it burns a lot of adrenaline, which is exhausting"), Armstrong worked on a string of big films and doubled James Bond. On the first Indiana Jones film, Steven Spielberg confused him for Harrison Ford and a career-spanning relationship began, with Armstrong doubling Ford as Indy, Han Solo and many others.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/10/vic-armstrong-stunt-man-indiana-jones-body-image-1455131164.jpeg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="640" data-original-height="437" data-model-id="144583" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="vic-armstrong-stunt-man-indiana-jones-body-image-1455131164.jpeg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>Vic and Harrison Ford in Spain, on the set of Indiana Jones</em>
</p><p>"I've told Harrison a number of times that if he wasn't such a good actor he'd be a great stuntman," Armstrong says of the man he's so regularly stood in for. "He's a carpenter, he's got a logical brain on him and he's an absolute perfectionist – his scripts are always covered in notes at the beginning of shooting."
</p><p>A picture sent from Ford to Armstrong is inscribed with the line: "If you learn to talk, I'm in deep trouble."
</p><p>Today, the stunt community is much bigger than it was when Armstrong began.
</p><p>"When I started there were probably 40 people doing it, and now there are 400, I should imagine," he says. It's still a "lovely business", but it's very competitive and you don't know everyone else in the way you used to. "I was very lucky that I met some of the people that formed the business. I came in at the cusp of the new wave, if you like," says Armstrong.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/10/vic-armstrong-stunt-man-indiana-jones-body-image-1455131264.jpeg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="774" data-original-height="541" data-model-id="144585" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="vic-armstrong-stunt-man-indiana-jones-body-image-1455131264.jpeg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>Vic and his wife Wendy on the set of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'</em>
</p><p>One of those men was George Leech, part of a generation of men who used their military experience in the Second World War to carve out a career in the film industry, arranging and performing action sequences. Leech's daughter, Wendy, followed him into the business, and on the Superman films starring Christopher Reeve she doubled Margot Kidder, who played Lois Lane. Armstrong was doubling Reeve and so, as Superman and Lois Lane, they met and went on to marry and appear in a series of films side-by-side.
</p><p>CGI has changed things "incredibly for the better", says Armstrong, adding that he often likens it to morphine, in that it's an incredible drug when used in the right way for the right thing, but if you get hooked, well then hey, it's very damaging. Films can be ruined by CGI, but it means that all sorts of safety mechanisms can be used and then just taken out in the edit. When he was doing Indiana Jones "everything had to be in the camera frame" and thus had to be concealed, like the pegs he used to jump from the horse to the tank. Now, Armstrong can send Andrew Garfield hurtling across a street in Spiderman and the devices he uses to make this possible will never be seen by the audience.
</p><p>The magic of the screen remains, though, and heading toward his 70th birthday, Vic Armstrong is back in the desert outside of Almeria, filming in Indiana Jones Canyon, still playing Cowboys and Indians.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">What's great about Valentine's Day is that it gives people in long term relationships a guarantee for sex. What if, after being together for a couple of years, the majority of your sexual encounters start taking place just before falling asleep at night – your teeth flossed and your pyjama top still on? The 14th of February is just around the corner, promising to make your sex life adventurous again. As long as you plan the entire evening in advance, that is.</p><p>We wanted to know how couples around the world are having organised sex this year, so we asked our international editors to visit their local sex shop and ask each owner about this week's best sellers.

</p><p>"Last Valentine's Day, people were into kink because of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>, but we're not selling as much of that stuff this year. Sex games and couples' toys are really popular, like the <span class="s1"><a href="http://www.dameproducts.com/products/eva">Eva Now</a> – </span>a hands-free couples vibrator which was actually crowdfunded by two Williamsburg girls.
</p><p>We've had a lot of women who don't normally wear lingerie come in to buy some, because that's what their partners want.

</p><p>"The stuff we sell isn't usually just for Valentine's, because it's more extreme, more specialist. If it is for Valentine's and it's a couple, they tend to get cock rings or something like this 12-inch veined double header, which they can both use. With normal sex shops the guys get what the girl wants – so things like fluffy nightgowns and stuff – whereas here it's with two guys, so the thought process is more, 'I want to do that to him.' Masculine sexuality is more aggressive.
</p><p class="p2">Red things sells well – but then it sells all the time as red in gay culture is associated with fist fucking, not Valentine's Day."

	"People come in on Valentine's Day to get gifts that are very romantic and intimate, rather than just fun or experimental. A lot of folks will come in trying to create a scene using several little items – love notes, candles, massage oils, small toys. Or they might go for a bigger ticket item like an expensive vibrator.

</p><p>The whole thing is framed as a long-forgotten TV movie from the 80s recently unearthed at a yard sale by director Ron Howard, who makes a cameo as himself.
</p><p>"The plan was to move really fast because we thought Trump would go away, at least as a presidential candidate," Funny or Die's editor-in-chief Owen Burke, who originally hatched the idea, told the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/movies/trump-movie-funny-or-die-johnny-depp.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below&_r=1" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em>. "When he bizarrely didn't go away, we had a little more time. But that meant keeping the secret for longer."<br>
</p><p>It's not easy for anyone to actually pull off a clandestine film production without news getting out around Hollywood, especially big-time talent like Depp or Adam McKay, Funny or Die co-creator and director of <em>The Big Short</em>, but they somehow managed to do it. </p><p>The results are glorious—there's a surplus of bad 80s TV movie tropes, a theme song by Kenny Loggins, and even an appearance by Henry Winkler. Take an hour break from work and <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/ad38087bac/donald-trump-art-of-the-deal-movie" target="_blank">watch the whole thing</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer first met the boastful perpetrators of a decades-old genocide in Indonesia, he was so taken aback by their cavalier attitude toward this horrible atrocity that he decided to spend the next few years of his life unmasking the country's failure to address these crimes through film. </p><p>"I thought, <em>My god, it's like I've wandered into Germany 40 years after the Holocaust only to find the</em><em> Nazis still in power.</em>I couldn't think of anything more important that I could possibly do."</p><p>He embedded in Indonesia, talking with war criminals and the victims of their horrific crimes, which resulted in two internationally acclaimed documentaries, <em>The Act of Killing</em> and <em>The Look of Silence</em>. Since the films' release, Oppenheimer spends his time traveling the world discussing Indonesia's current political situation.</p><p>"I think of myself less as a story teller and more as an explorer. And I see myself as taking these long, intimate, transformative journeys with people within the overall safe space of making a film."</p><p>In this episode of VICE's <em>Autobiographies</em>, Oppenheimer discusses the meticulous process behind the creation of his films, retraces the steps he took on his journey to becoming a documentarian, and addresses the impact his films have had in redefining history for the Indonesian people. </p><p><em>Download go90 to watch</em> Autobiographies <em>and more from VICE at </em><a href="http://www.go90.com/" target="_blank">www.go90.com</a>. <br></p>

<title>It&#039;s Hard Being a Fan of Kanye West</title>

<description><![CDATA[When West publicly discounts the rape accusations of more than 50 women, even I have to question whether there is something wrong with the picture he's painting.

<enclosure url="http://vice-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/02/10/why-cant-we-quit-kanye-west-456-1455141011.jpg" type="image/jpg" length="1024"></enclosure>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Keeping it real" is a concept that's
helped tether <a href="http://www.vice.com/video/kanye-west" target="_blank">Kanye West</a> to his audience for over a decade. His moves
subverted the double-consciousness: He wore his black Chicagoan roots on his
sleeve regardless of the white gaze, while he refused to let any monolithic concept
of blackness stifle his ambition.
</p><p class="Body">But it's only recently that the same strength, which helped make
him a centripetal cultural force, has become truly pernicious. The lead-up to 
	<i>T.L.O.P.</i>
	has been chaotic: G.O.O.D. Fridays only lasted two Fridays. A petty <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/tweef-alert-kanye-west-is-roasting-wiz-khalifa-on-twitter" target="_blank">Twitter rant against Wiz Khalifa</a> exposed West as an obsessive neurotic; he had to go out
of his way to defend his anus against Amber Rose. The title of his
next album changed from an onomatopoeia (
	<i>SWISH</i>) to a game show.
Yesterday, he <a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2016/02/kanye-west-bill-cosby-innocent" target="_blank">proclaimed Bill Cosby was innocent</a>—in
all caps—possibly setting the 
	<a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/697214447606042624" target="_blank">Freedom Tower on fire</a>.
</p><p class="Body">This might be the first time Kanye
West being Kanye West—that is, speaking before
thinking—has dragged his album rollout.
He started to regain whatever goodwill he lost with last year's "Facts" when he dropped "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in L.A.," the two 2016 G.O.O.D. Friday releases. The acclaim was
near unanimous, and placed together, they have a populist appeal: "Real Friends" was a
dour rehash of 
	<i>College Dropout</i>'s "Family Business," great
for the classicists, and "No More
Parties in LA"
is a current-state-of-Kanye thriller. Unfortunately, those songs couldn't compete with his PR blunders. Usually, the buzz around a great West track lasts for weeks. But this time around, his lead singles have faded from memory, while his alleged penchant for anal-play is still trending and inspiring memes.
</p><p class="Body">West is imploding as the zeitgeist
presses forward. Kendrick Lamar's 
	<i>To Pimp a Butterfly </i>is
a black cultural milestone racking up Grammy nominations. Drake is owning the transparency lane that Kanye
West built with chart-topping singles. Beyoncé continues to be more
subversive as her fame grows. It isn't just
that West is losing his cultural cache; frankly, it's easier for fans like me to redirect the energy we usually waste defending him and use that to focus on other artists.</p><p><strong><em>Watch Spike Jonze interview Kanye West back in 2007</em></strong></p><iframe src="//embeds.vice.com/?playerId=YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5&aid=vice.com/spike-spends-saturday-with&vid=xsdHdrMjrYsZMqr12rdpzPAU-ZlTzd_L&embedCode=xsdHdrMjrYsZMqr12rdpzPAU-ZlTzd_L&cust_params=embdom%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fkanye-west%26topic%3Dmusic%26aid%3Dkanye-west%26auth%3D%26keywords%3D%26ac%3Dno%26country%3Den_us%26contentId%3DxsdHdrMjrYsZMqr12rdpzPAU-ZlTzd_L&ad_rule=1&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fkanye-west&autoplay=0&share_url=http://www.vice.com/video/kanye-west" width="100%" height="360px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe><p class="Body">But I simply can't quit West. This was an artist who, in 2004, taught myself and hundreds of thousands of other prepubescents and teenagers (today's creatives) that their concept of blackness was valid—that it wasn't an alternative, but stood equal within black America's multitudes. So we stood with him when he went from a pink polo-wearing outsider to
becoming one of hip-hop's most famous ambassadors. 
	<i>Yeezus
	</i>might be, at its best, a vanity project driven by his fashion industry
frustrations, but there was a shared vindication in him carving out his own
avant-garde space to rant. His declaration that he was running for the presidency in 2020 might've been
kicked off by a barely coherent speech, but the effect was vicarious. West was
dancing atop the glass ceiling that's blocked so many of us.</p><p class="Body">Unfortunately, West's
past few months have been caked with misogyny, implicit homophobia, and
self-aggrandizement. What was at the center of those first two albums was how they captured the un-sanitized
black soul and its dimensions—pride, insecurities, flawed
humanity, and potential. When he reached his commercial peak with 
	<i>Graduation</i> he became living proof of the maxim "do you
and they will follow." People don't get that famous based simply off artistry. West has garnered a cult of personality driven by the way his humanness is intertwined with his
celebrity. 
	
</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242539038&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true">
</iframe><p class="Body">And I think that's why I just can't
escape Kanye West. His art is always pushing the game forward. Before others can catch up, he's off exploring new forms of expression. Who else has been able to be this loud and this famous for this long within a white space? So I bristle when his detractors tell him to be meek, to neuter
his pride because it makes them uncomfortable.
</p><p>I'll definitely be following on Thursday as he finally unveils his new album at Madison Square Garden, but this time it will be with more curiosity than glee. Because the truth is, "keeping it real" and "being yourself" can't absolve Yeezus of all his sins. When West publicly discounts the rape accusations of more than 50 women who have nothing to gain, even I, a longtime fan, have to question whether there is something wrong with the picture he's painting. To
love something is to ask for the best in that thing. I love Kanye West, but right now he isn't at his best.

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images<br></p><p>Pretty much every presidential candidate who isn't Jeb Bush can tell a story about how their parents would never have imagined their child achieving such great things. But when Bernie Sanders evoked the memory of his parents raising him in a small, rent-controlled Brooklyn apartment while celebrating <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-conquered-the-new-hampshire-primaries" target="_blank">his victory in the New Hampshire primary</a> Tuesday, it was especially easy to imagine their amazement. The 74-year-old scruffy Jewish socialist's campaign's success would have shocked them, but it also caught pretty much the entire political system by surprise. </p><p>Even for pundits who knew that support for Sanders has been growing in recent months, the New Hampshire results were striking. The Vermont senator won New Hampshire with 60 percent of the vote, far ahead of Hillary Clinton's 38 percent, a bigger margin of victory than most polls had been predicting. Until mid-January, the well-respected data journalism site <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/new-hampshire-democratic/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a> had anticipated an outright Clinton win in the state. And Clinton has absolutely crushed her opponent when it comes to getting endorsements from elected officials and other prominent figures.</p><p>Of course, for a lot of Sanders supporters, including many of the ones who filled the gym at Concord High School for the Sanders primary night party, that lack of establishment support is a big part of his appeal. </p><p>Elias Tyrrel-Walker, a 17-year-old high school senior, has been volunteering for the Sanders campaign at local colleges even though he's not yet old enough to vote himself.</p><p>"I feel like he's just something new," he said. "It seems like he's running on a platform of ideas people actually care about."</p><p><strong><em>Read: </em></strong><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/how-the-republican-candidates-new-hampshire-predictions-got-it-wrong" target="_blank"><strong><em>How the Republican Candidates' New Hampshire Predictions Got It Wrong</em></strong></a></p><p>The party, filled with volunteers who ranged from Tyrrel-Walker's age to Sanders's, was packed with national and international media. There was stomping, shouting, and a set, heavy on disco and funk, from DJ Mel of Austin, who also played Obama's 2013 inaugural ball.</p><p>If the primary result didn't make it clear, the Sanders operation is getting more serious than it was when it began: Early in the evening, several dozen supporters found themselves milling outside the high school in 20-degree weather because they lacked tickets that no one had told them they needed. (Finally, well after the primary had been declared for Sanders, they were finally allowed in.)</p><p>After the crowd had watched Clinton's concession speech on the big screen, Sanders took the stage and quickly made note of how many voters had come to the polls. "Yuge voter turnout," he said, prompting the crowed to echo back, "Yuge!"</p><p>"What happened here in New Hampshire in terms of an enthused electorate—this is what will happen all over this country," he went, before launching into a comprehensive stump speech about government-run health care, free college, criminal justice reforms, climate change, and the rest of his liberalism-on-steroids agenda.</p><p>For the most part, Sanders struck a pleasant tone toward Clinton, congratulating her campaign on its hard work and insisting that Democrats unite around whoever is chosen as the nominee. But he also acknowledged the increasingly aggressive intra-party contest.</p><p>"They're throwing everything against me except the kitchen sink, and I have a feeling that kitchen sink is coming soon," he said.</p><p>But many of the Sanders supporters at the event said tension with Clinton was a nonissue and that they'd obviously support her in the general election if it was necessary to keep a Republican out of the White House. </p><p>Silvia Styles, a 60-year-old volunteer who said her politics have been getting more progressive since the Bush-Cheney years, said the Sanders campaign seems to be pushing Clinton left.</p><p>"I hear Hillary say the kinds of things recently that Bernie's been saying this whole time," she said.</p><p>Brian Tourgee said he had actively considered voting for Clinton in the primary. He preferred Sanders's policy positions but worried about how he'd fare in a general election. Tourgee's 18-year-old daughter Michelle had been volunteering with the campaign, but he's had his heart broken by political campaigns before and didn't get as involved as she did, he said. But he copped to a certain amount of excitement about the election results.</p><p>"It's a good time to be a liberal," he said. "I'm not going to run away from that word."</p><p>Some Sanders fans, however, seemed shaken by the loud conflicts with the Clinton campaign in recent weeks. Will Stockinger, a recent college graduate who's enthusiastic about getting money out of politics, said it's possible he might stay home on Election Day in November.</p><p>"At first I was sure I would vote for Hillary if she got the nomination, but as the campaign goes on I am less and less sure of that," he said.</p><p>Stockinger said he sees himself as an independent because he's frustrated with the entire political system. He said the same is true of many of his friends, who span the ideological spectrum from Greens to libertarians. And Clinton seems to be very much a part of that system.</p><p>For other supporters, the key to Sanders's appeal is his economic message. Matt Firmani, who traveled from Boston to see the candidate and ended up sitting on stage behind him, said a couple of years ago he was struggling to get by at a minimum-wage job. He eventually signed up for government assistance, which helped him make it through the rough patch and get a much better job at the 3D printing company where he works now.</p><p>"I really, really, really do believe in government as a service for the people," he said.</p><p>John Mark Blowen, a 68-year-old former draft resister who had steered clear of politics for decades, echoed that sentiment.</p><p>"What he's saying is that government is the way we take care of each other," he said. "I don't know if he can win, but he's moving things in the direction of human beings looking out for one another."</p><p>The question of whether Sanders could possibly win the nomination is, of course, a highly debatable one. New Hampshire has the advantage of being next to his home state. And Democratic voters in New Hampshire—as well as in Iowa, where he lost to Clinton by a hair—are largely white liberals, the group he's been doing best with so far. In national polls, he's consistently been behind Clinton. And the next states to vote, Nevada and South Carolina, have Democratic electorates that are less liberal and much less overwhelmingly white.</p><p>But Sanders's first step toward winning in those states is to get voters across the country to take a closer look at him. And his big New Hampshire win is going to convince a lot of people to do just that.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diana Ware has been waiting almost three decades to see justice for her stepdaughter Barbara, whose body was <a href="http://homicide.latimes.com/post/barbara-ware/" target="_blank">discovered</a> in 1987 in a South Los Angeles alley buried under trash and a gas tank. Since Lonnie David Franklin, Jr., better known as the Grim Sleeper, was arrested in 2010, the elder Ware says she's taken hundreds of bus trips from West Covina to downtown LA to attend pre-trial hearings. </p><p>"It's beginning to take a little bit of a toll," Ware tells me.</p><p>Her legs and knees are beginning to give out, but Ware trudges on for Barbara—and for her own late husband, who she says died before discovering his daughter was the victim of a serial killer. "He was thinking it was just another murder in South Central," she explains.</p><p>After more than two decades of allegedly wreaking terror on the streets of South Los Angeles, Franklin—who if convicted would be the longest-active serial killer in California history—is going on trial this month. The arduous road leading up to this moment has been frustrating for cops and community members alike. Critics of the LAPD say they were lazy in their investigation, neglected to follow up on leads, and regarded the victims as insignificant because they were black women, and some were sex workers. Police paint a much different picture, describing a complicated array of factors that made finding the Grim Sleeper extremely tough, including the height of the crack cocaine epidemic, a surge in violent crime, and even other active serial killers.</p><p>In fact, Franklin was only arrested in 2010 after pioneering DNA technology—and a semi-secretive police task force—helped connect him to at least ten murders that stretched from 1985 to 2007, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The gruesome nickname refers to the "hiatus" police initially believed Franklin took from killing in the 1990s, though it's possible he simply hasn't been connected to murders in that era.</p><p>All of Franklin's alleged victims were black women between the ages of 15 and 35. All were shot, strangled or both. Most were callously discarded in bushes, alleyways or dumpsters, in various states of undress. One victim, 22-year-old Lachrica Jefferson, was found in January 1988 with a napkin placed across her face with the word "AIDS" written on it, according to court documents.</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/how-a-slice-of-pizza-may-have-helped-catch-california-longest-active-serial-killer-body-image-1455122411-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="2500" data-original-height="1656" data-model-id="144509" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="how-a-slice-of-pizza-may-have-helped-catch-california-longest-active-serial-killer-body-image-1455122411.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="photo-credit">Victims of the Grim Sleeper on the wall at activist Margaret Prescod's office in Los Angeles. Photo by David Austin</p><p>Although a 2011 grand jury <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/03/grim-sleeper-arraigned-on-grand-jury-indictment-in-killings-of-10-women.html" target="_blank">indictment</a> was expected to speed up the death penalty case, delays and bizarre courtroom antics have dragged on pre-trial proceedings for more than five years. Witnesses have retired or died, and new experts have had to be summoned to reanalyze evidence, according to Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman. Meanwhile, the victims' families have been waiting for some sort of resolution, and some have even passed away while waiting for trial.</p><p>"That means that some of these victims will have no one to speak for them or about them at penalty phase, or to see that justice was done at the end of this process," Silverman writes VICE in an email. "To me, that is a disgrace."</p><p>In addition to Ware and Jefferson, Franklin is accused of killing 18-year-old Alicia Alexander; 35-year-old Valerie McCorvey; 34-year-old Henrietta Wright; 29-year-old Debra Jackson; 26-year-old Bernita Sparks; 26-year-old Mary Lowe; 25-year-old Janecia Peters; and 15-year-old Princess Berthomieux. Franklin is also charged with the attempted murder of 30-year-old Enietra Washington, whom he allegedly picked up in his car, shot in the chest, sexually assaulted, and dumped on the street.</p><p>Upon Franklin's arrest, a police search of his property yielded a trove of naked photos, videos, and homemade porn, prompting speculation about how high the real victim count might climb. The LAPD <a href="http://s782.photobucket.com/user/lpklapdonline/slideshow/Grim Sleeper Photos/?albumview=slideshow" target="_blank">posted</a> a photo gallery online with portraits of nearly 200 women in the hopes of identifying and locating them. Today, at least 35 photos <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/as-grim-sleeper-murder-trial-nears-police-cant-find-35-women-in-photos-6565826" target="_blank">remain</a>, and police are still seeking the public's help. </p><p>(Franklin <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grim-sleeper-suspect-lonnie-franklin-jr-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank">pleaded not guilty</a> to all murder charges when they were first leveled in 2010.)</p><p>Horrifying as it may be that a serial murderer would remain loose for so many years, there were a slew of issues at the time that made this case tricky, according to LAPD Detective Daryn Dupree, the current lead investigator on the case. Beginning in the late 1970s and stretching well into the 80s, crack cocaine took South LA by storm, he says, leading to a spike in drug-related crime, drive-by shootings, and murders. This was only further muddied by the activities of other serial killers in the surrounding areas.</p><p>"There were so many people dying out there," Dupree tells me. "It was hard for police to decipher the different MOs."</p><p>During this era, killings spiked in Los Angeles. Between 1970 and 1979, the homicide rate in LA city alone rose 84 percent, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr//preview/mmwrhtml/00000841.htm" target="_blank">according</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). DNA technology was limited, so police had to rely on basics like witness testimony and ballistics evidence, and although DNA obtained at many of the crime scenes was run against CODIS—the FBI's national databank—it didn't strike a match.</p><p>In fact, it wasn't until 2008 that California adopted a new (and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09sleeper.html" target="_blank">controversial</a>) DNA practice that ultimately provided investigators with the lynchpin they needed to nab Franklin. The state was the first to adopt a familial search program, which uses "unique computer software and rigorous protocols" to link a "family member of a convicted offender with DNA taken from a murder or rape scene," state Attorney General Edmund Brown Jr. explained in a <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/browns-forensic-experts-identify-grim-sleeper-serial-killer-suspect-through" target="_blank">statement</a> after Franklin's arrest. </p><p>When Franklin's son was <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grim-sleeper-arrest-who-is-lonnie-franklin-jr/" target="_blank">arrested</a> on a felony weapons charge in 2009, a sample of his DNA was sent to the state data bank. There, the lab uncovered a link between Franklin's son and DNA evidence collected at the Grim Sleeper murder scenes, and leap-frogged to Franklin. (Franklin's son himself was never considered a suspect in the case, police say.)</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/how-a-slice-of-pizza-may-have-helped-catch-californias-longest-active-serial-killer-body-image-1455124196-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="2400" data-original-height="1846" data-model-id="144535" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="how-a-slice-of-pizza-may-have-helped-catch-californias-longest-active-serial-killer-body-image-1455124196.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="photo-credit">Lonnie Franklin Jr., right, the alleged Grim Sleeper serial killer, at a pre-trial hearing in August 2015. (Photo by Al Seib / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)</p><p>On July 5, 2010, two LAPD detectives keeping tabs on Franklin <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-20140108-story.html" target="_blank">saw him</a> head into Buena Park restaurant called John's Incredible Pizza for a kid's birthday party, according to court documents. One of the detectives donned a restaurant uniform, posed as an employee, and collected napkins, glasses, a fork, and a partially-eaten slice of pizza from Franklin. DNA evidence from these items clinched the cops' case, and two days later they arrested Franklin.</p><p>Of course, for many in South LA and beyond, this apparent resolution comes way too late. Critics argue the LAPD waited far too long to warn people there was even a serial killer on the loose. Some say it was only after<em> LA Weekly</em> reporter Christine Pelisek <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tv/tv-movie-dramatizes-grim-sleeper-killings-213331423.html" target="_blank">broke the news</a> to the victims' families that the news really went public.</p><p>Margaret Prescod, founder of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blackcoalitionfightsback" target="_blank">Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders</a>, argues the lives of the women killed seemed to be of "less value" to the LAPD (and much of the mainstream media) for too long.</p><p>"The women were impoverished, they were black, they were women," Presocd says. "We knew right away that if this many women had been murdered in an affluent part of Los Angeles, that that would not be the case."</p><p>Through her coalition, Prescod says she rallied a crew to distribute more than 100,000 flyers in the community, including to the "working women... on the strip." The group also organized weekly vigils outside police headquarters and started issuing press releases in a bid to force police, city officials, and the media to pay attention to the murders.</p><p>One of Prescod's first (and ongoing) disputes with the LAPD was over their classification and description of the deaths as "the prostitute killings." Although many of Franklin's victims were sex workers, some perhaps lured into his grasp by the promise of crack cocaine, the LAPD's label was derogatory and inaccurate, according to Prescod, as some of the victims were not even involved in sex work.</p><p>"This whole image of who the women were was problematic also, because it gave other women a false sense of security," Prescod tells me. "To say, 'Well if I'm not a sex worker, I don't have to worry,' you know, without knowing that there's somebody out there hunting down and killing women."</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/how-a-slice-of-pizza-may-have-helped-catch-californias-longest-active-serial-killer-body-image-1455124314-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="2500" data-original-height="1656" data-model-id="144542" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="how-a-slice-of-pizza-may-have-helped-catch-californias-longest-active-serial-killer-body-image-1455124314.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="photo-credit">Margaret Prescod at her office in Los Angeles. Photo by David Austin </p><p>Prescod continues to host coalition meetings, is pushing to get a memorial installed to honor the victims, and remains in touch with many of the family members today. That includes Porter Alexander Jr., whose daughter Alicia was one of the youngest victims; at 18, she was found naked with a shirt knotted around her neck, hidden under a foam mattress in an alley, court documents say.</p><p>"He took the most precious thing  could have ever, more or less, been given to me," Alexander says in an interview. "He took my child."</p><p>Since Franklin's arrest, there's been an HBO documentary called <em>Tales of the Grim Sleeper</em> and a Lifetime movie called <em>The Grim Sleeper </em>made about him. Media coverage of his case has been sporadic, but interest in the trial has grown so intense that there's now a press waitlist to secure a spot in the courtroom audience on Tuesday.</p><p>Families like Alexander's will be guaranteed seats. After all these years, the 75-year-old father is just hoping to have his daughter's life understood, and if the jury finds Franklin guilty, for justice to be doled out with no restraint.</p><p>"There's no rehabilitation for him. He's too far gone," Alexander says of Franklin. "He either gets life without parole, or give him death."</p><p><em>Follow Hayley Fox on <a href="https://twitter.com/epfox" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p>

Screenshot via YouTube<br></p><p dir="ltr">When asked what you know about <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/ren%C3%A9-ang%C3%A9lil-dead-c%C3%A9line-dion-s-husband-dead-at-73-1.3007809" target="_blank">René Angélil</a>, you'd probably say he was Celine Dion's husband, manager, father of her kids, and the architect of her rise to global superstardom. And you'd be right.</p><p dir="ltr">When he died of throat cancer last month, the Montreal-born impresario was given a lavish funeral, and tributes poured in from across the entertainment world. Most of the tributes and obits focused on his stunningly successful career managing his wife. One weird detail that was left out, however, was his brief appearance in a film that changed both the Quebec film industry and Quebec's then-notoriously conservative, Catholic Church–dominated culture.</p><p dir="ltr">The movie was called <em>Après-ski</em>. Its US English title is <em>Snowballin'</em>. It's a soft-core, lowest-of-low-brow ski comedy, barely watchable today. But shortly after its 1971 release, it became massively controversial, and extremely profitable, pulling in about $2 million , according to its director, Cardinal. It was so popular it was distributed to the UK and US, where it was spliced with scenes from actual pornos to spice things up even more.</p><p dir="ltr">The movie seems to hold a special place in Cardinal's heart. You can tell he's both fond of and somewhat embarrassed by it. "<em>Après-ski</em> is not the movie I want to be remembered by. I'm not proud of it, but I did make my name with it."</p><p dir="ltr">Cardinal went on to a successful career in Canadian movies, with a Genie nomination for his 1988 feature <em>Malarek</em> (he'd lose to David Cronenberg's <em>Dead Ringers</em>), and now teaches cinema. And for all its controversy, <em>Après-ski</em> went on to <a href="http://blog.canuxploitation.com/2013/05/motion-picture-purgatory-apres-ski-1971/" target="_blank">become a cult classic</a>, and its soundtrack was recently reissued.</p><p dir="ltr">"I asked my students how many of them had heard of it," he says. Very few had.

</p><p>I'd like to introduce you to some of my closest, most loyal companions.
</p><p>First up, circumlocutory Joe – a dear friend of mine, a sergeant, who died gracefully (legs blown off, screaming) after the cover he was hiding behind was hit by grenade fire. Then there's Captain not-James-T Kirk. Stupid, gentle Captain not-James-T Kirk: a buffoon who managed to get himself captured, and whom I never bothered to save from the clutches of the enemy, even though I probably could have.
</p><p>Enter corporals Sean Bell and Andi Hamilton, a thunderous duo of barely-in-shape gung-ho hurricanes: now both dead, cut down mercilessly during Operation Seething Fork, or something like that. PJ "Warhorse" O'Reilly lost the will to live when an alien Sectoid took control of his mind. When he started firing on my other squad mates, we had to put him down like a dog. Luck of the Irish.
</p><p>Tamoor "The Animal" Hussain, a bearded tank of a man I had recruited from Resistance HQ, had a lot promise. Yet despite his foreboding physical appearance, Tamoor was slaughtered during his first proper tour of duty. There have been others, too. Many more. Gary, Dan, Tom, Mum... life is fragile.
</p><p>All of my friends – and mum – have something in common. They all ran out of time.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/the-brilliant-new-strategy-game-xcom-2-turns-time-itself-against-the-player-745-body-image-1455126730-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1920" data-original-height="1080" data-model-id="144567" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="the-brilliant-new-strategy-game-xcom-2-turns-time-itself-against-the-player-745-body-image-1455126730.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>You see, with the freshly released <em>XCOM 2</em>, developer Firaxis has once again crafted a strategy game quite unlike any other, successfully refining practically everything that was so damn good about <em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</em>, the studio's 2012 reboot of 1994's original <em>UFO: Enemy Unknown</em>. But they've also gone beyond expectations, over-delivering in almost every respect, adding significant strategic depth and building new features that consistently delight, surprise and genuinely terrify even the most experienced of XCOM players. Despite putting over 70 hours into <em>Enemy Unknown</em>, I still felt most comfortable nudging its sequel down to its easiest difficulty, until I had a firmer grasp of everything new that this game has hiding in its fog of war.
</p><p>The game is at its most ruthless when it uses your own time against you, and in order to succeed you have to learn to be efficient. <em>XCOM 2</em>, which pits your human resistance force (namely XCOM) against the alien occupiers of Earth (read our <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/welcome-back-commander-in-conversation-with-firaxis-about-xcom-2-554" target="_blank">interview from 2015</a> for more story background), communicates a feeling of brutal intelligence; it makes you feel clever and genuinely overwhelmed with relief for succeeding with each mission, but that success is never easily earned. It also never gives you the confidence to think you'll breeze through the next mission. There's nothing permanent here – make a bad decision, or even the right decision but at the wrong time, and your failure is always a turn or two away, be that the death of a squad mate, a devastating attack on your mobile command centre, or any other number of potentially game-changing threats that lie in wait throughout the game's lengthy campaign. The relief of getting home safe or successfully saving a settlement lingers briefly in the mind before you're firefighting your next emergency. Your eyes are always on a clock.

</p><p>Most if not all of the game's missions require you to "get it done" within a certain number of turns. For example, head into battle and you'll need to complete your objective and get to the evacuation zone before the time runs out – anyone outside of that zone when the timer hits zero gets left behind, captured by enemy forces. In some missions, you'll need to kill all enemies in the vicinity, albeit in just five or so turns, otherwise a dropship will arrive with reinforcements, increasing the pressure on your troops who are already struggling against an enemy that greatly outnumbers them.
</p><p>In the overarching strategic decisions that determine how you and your ragtag resistance buddies progress through the campaign, you'll find that the passage of time works against you there, too. Every day that goes by is another day closer to the aliens' completion of the Avatar Project, a mysterious program shrouded in secrecy but that definitely threatens to render all your resistance efforts futile. It's essentially the penultimate step before Game Over.
</p><p>This could have been an incredibly annoying design decision – strategy games often give players the freedom to plan how they want to experiment with systems. But <em>XCOM 2</em> constrains the boundaries and instead wants you to get things done on its terms. It works surprisingly well as a new tactical consideration, and instead of constricting your gameplay options it instead forces you to think differently, and more efficiently. There's a real sense of speed to everything you do. Additional objectives suddenly become something you need to fit into the current parameters of the mission, rather than just undertake at your leisure. And when you get down to two remaining turns and still need to get four of your six-person squad to evac, it becomes fucking tense.

</iframe><p>During a particularly tough mission, I had to not only take down a VIP target – my primary objective – but also use a piece of resistance-developed technology against a high-ranking enemy officer, to basically rip data from his alien brain. Doing this, I was told, would give the resistance an upper hand; but getting up close with alien forces on the battlefield poses obvious risks. As XCOM's enemies gets tougher and your soldiers rank up, it becomes a strategic decision as to who you take into the field. Take a squad full of your best troops and you're less likely to take casualties; but should you incur any losses, they're far more damaging to the overall strength of XCOM than if you'd lost a newly recruited rookie. But in order to try guarantee success, I took the risk and sent out my finest.
</p><p>Five soldiers, all experienced, and all running out of time. I had 12 turns. Just a dozen moves to find the currently unidentified VIP, kill or capture them, deal with the fallout (capturing someone means one of your squad is out of action while they're carrying a target), then move into a strong enough strategic position to put one of my men at risk of death by sending him toe-to-toe with a big-ass bad guy. And only then, once all that was done, could I move to the evac point.

</p><p>Of course, I fucked it. Two of my guys got gravely wounded, so I was moving them with great care, wasting valuable turns making sure they were never out of full cover – <em>XCOM 2</em>'s AI exploits squad vulnerabilities with ruthless precision. Getting the VIP captured went a bit wrong, too – I managed to subdue and carry them to relative safety, but when a nearby car exploded it killed them and halved my soldier's health. Two and a half men down, I was literally operating at half capacity – yet I somehow managed to mind-jack the enemy officer, keeping my eyes fixed on the clock at all times. But then came an unexpected blow: using mind control caused this weird living computer-thing mini-boss to appear, teleporting across the map and cloning itself at will. Pants.
</p><p>I finally ended up killing it, but used up my last few precious turns doing so. I left that mission with one soldier so injured that he was out of action for over a dozen in-game days. XCOM being XCOM, this caused ramifications that stifled my progress for several hours. I had to waste time rescuing captured soldiers from enemy control, and what squad I had to play with was left severely impaired by the loss of such levelled-up comrades. And every day that I was patching XCOM up, the aliens were getting closer to activating the Avatar Project. The very real stress I'd felt before losing my best on the battlefield was only growing. And time was passing, inexorably, whatever my efforts to catch up to it.
</p><p><em>XCOM 2 </em>is a wonderful game, absolutely one of the best strategy titles you'll play this or any other year. It's unusually smart, ruthless and expects you to always be thinking ahead: to your next turn, to your next battle, to your next (possibly final) decision. But for me, its most cruelly unique feature is how all of its mechanics come together to create this constantly ticking bomb, that makes every minute of the game feel precious and important. No matter if you've an entire day to play, or just an hour one evening after you've finished all of your shitty real-life chores, <em>XCOM 2</em> gives you <em>time</em>, and with it you'll make a real tangible difference to the future of its depiction of mankind – for better, or worse.

</p><p class="photo-credit">Junior doctors on strike
</p><p>Britain's
junior doctors are out on strike for the second time in a month today. Their
grievances are the same as 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/junior-doctors-strike-access" target="_blank">last time:</a> opposition to a proposed contract that would make them work until 10PM without overtime and make Saturday part of the normal working week. After the last strike, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt 
	<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-hunt-warns-could-force-7183463" target="_blank">signalled</a> that he'd enforce the new contract whatever
the doctors thought, which didn't do much to cool tensions.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">With
future strike days planned and a poll on Tuesday 
	<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ninety-per-cent-of-junior-doctors-would-resign-over-new-contract-poll-finds-a6863796.html" target="_blank">showing</a> that 90 percent of junior doctors would consider quitting if Jeremy Hunt forced the proposals through, it doesn't look like an agreement will be reached any time soon. Today, Jeremy Hunt was
pleading with doctors to "do the right thing", which in this case seems to mean "shut up and take the pain". He thanked the doctors who did go to work, but
despite their efforts nearly 3,000 operations were cancelled.
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal"> 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Since
the first strike, public opinion has largely been with the doctors, and support
only seems to have grown. A poll found today that the public 
	<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/public-overwhelmingly-blame-jeremy-hunt-for-junior-doctors-strike-poll-finds-a6864666.html" target="_blank">overwhelmingly</a>
	blame Jeremy Hunt for the strike.
</p><p>VICE went down to Brighton General Hospital
to pick the brains of patients and ask what they thought of the strike.

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Peter Triste, 67<br></strong>I'm here
waiting for my friend who's been in hospital. My opinion is that no one wants
to be affected by a strike, but at the same time I think it's important to ask
the question: why do they feel they need to? With all of the cuts, they must be
under hellish pressure. By making them work so hard, I think the government is
playing on the loyalty of the staff. I don't think they get their worth – let's
put it that way.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">My own GP
has gone early because, at his age, he didn't want to work under the new regime.
Anyone operating under duress – as it seems the junior doctors will be under
the new contract – will not work as well as they can do. In terms of solutions
to all this, I mean, I wouldn't mind paying an extra 20p in the pound on
taxation if it meant we had a good health service, but there you go. 
	<strong></strong>
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/asking-patients-about-the-junior-doctors-strike-body-image-1455118086-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="800" data-model-id="144473" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="asking-patients-about-the-junior-doctors-strike-body-image-1455118086.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Miriam Binder, 59<br></strong>I was last
in the hospital a week ago for something unexpected that came up, but I've come
down here today to support the doctors. I've had a lot of experience as a
patient in the NHS: both good and bad. I've got vascular disease so have had a
lot of treatment to do with that. I have a grandson who desperately needs
mental health care at the moment and can't get it. I have a daughter who is due
to undergo brain surgery. I have a foster child who has undergone brain
surgery. And my other daughter had her kids here in this hospital. When you
look at the low level of funding the NHS has got, when you look at what the
doctors are actually managing to deliver, it's outstanding. Absolutely
outstanding.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Nobody
becomes a doctor because it's an easy job; slugging your guts out for seven
years. The government's taking advantage of that dedication and commitment. If
the government wins this – If the government wins this! I daren't even think
about it.

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Jo Borne, 48<br></strong>My son's
here for a clinic; it's a regular thing – he's disabled and I'm his carer. We
haven't been affected by the strikes so far. I don't know a lot about the
strike, but I'm for it. Definitely. Wholeheartedly. I don't see a lot of junior
doctors at the hospital – we normally see the consultants – but the doctors who
we do see are doing a great job. I think they're doing the right thing
striking. I think they work hard with the hours they put in, and they have to
deal with a lot of stress and often difficult patients.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">If the government
tried to privatise the NHS I think it would be the worst thing they could do
for everyone. The
NHS has done a lot for my family. If it wasn't for them my husband wouldn't be
here. He's got an aggressive brain tumour. He's had two operations to remove
it. He has chemotherapy and radio therapy and regular MRI scans. My life would
have been turned upside down without the NHS.

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>David Mercer, 68<br></strong>I definitely
think it's right that they should go on strike. If they're overworked and tired
it's going to lead to misdiagnosis and other things; it's bad for the patients
and it's bad for them. Critics of the strike say things like: "They've always
worked hard" and "That's the way it's always been." Well, just because it has
been that way, doesn't make it right, does it? I haven't been affected directly,
which surprised me, as I'm up here fairly regularly. People moan about waiting
all day, but if you're ill, you're ill: you can wait anywhere. I'm happy with

very good treatment, very good food, I've been looked after very well,

doctors work longer hours, they should get paid overtime. I think making them
work harder will make the whole system less efficient; the doctors will get
tired and it might be dangerous. I think, simply, they shouldn't be expected to
work overtime and longer hours. And who should make these decisions? The
government? Hmm.

</p><p>In today's age of insatiable austerity, it can sometimes be a struggle to find ways of saving money. Other than having Sainsbury's Basics ham and coleslaw for lunch and dinner and staying indoors every weekend to watch your life pass you slowly by, there isn't a great deal you can do. So thank god for wombling, a new and inventive way of saving those precious pennies.
</p><p>Named after those fictional furry animals that just loved to collect your refuse, wombling is a new trend of money-saving in which you basically hang about in supermarket and fast food restaurant car parks and look for discarded receipts. Due to the high number of price guarantee and loyalty schemes available these days, many receipts will often have barcodes that you can scan and save money on your next shop with.
</p><p>58-year-old retiree <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/12139703/Secrets-of-a-Wombler-I-make-200-a-month-gathering-discarded-supermarket-receipts.html" target="_blank">Stephen Auker</a>, from Keighley, west Yorkshire, started the trend and he reckons he makes up to £200 a month, or £2,400 a year, scanning the codes off other people's detritus. And he's not just some lone money-saving maverick either: he's started a Facebook group that has over 5,000 followers.
</p><p>Keen to get in on this action, we sent two of our interns out on a wombling trip of their own, to see if they too can partake in the glory of 'saving money by picking up old receipts in car parks'.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/we-tried-wombling-the-cool-new-trend-where-you-pick-up-peoples-crappy-old-receipts-909-body-image-1455118591-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1088" data-original-height="816" data-model-id="144478" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="we-tried-wombling-the-cool-new-trend-where-you-pick-up-peoples-crappy-old-receipts-909-body-image-1455118591.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><h2>TOM USHER, WOMBLER</h2><p>When braving the cold sharp sun of a Wednesday morning to go and pick up other people's discarded receipts for tuppence, a few things travel through your mind. How did it get to this stage? What is my life saying? And most importantly, how can I go around picking up other people's discarded receipts for tuppence without anyone actually seeing my face?
</p><p>But there was no time for such self-conscious thoughts; I needed action. I began scouring the floor on the local high street, in every crack and crevice on the side of the road, nonchalantly whistling like a Looney Tunes character every time someone came near me or made anything resembling eye contact. I instantly found two brown Tesco receipts, so instantly my insecurities were paying dividends.
</p><p>I moved further away, towards a train station. According to the honourable Womble code and actual plain old UK law, it is illegal to hassle customers for receipts or look inside bins in or outside stores. But godammit, I was desperate. I darted into a Sainsbury's Local and eyed up a bin full of sweet, delicious receipts, casually tossed away by the self-service checkouts as if they were nothing. Do these people not realise what a goldmine they are sitting on? I made a dart for one of the bins by the entrance but a piercing look from a cashier stopped me dead in my pathetic paper-chasing tracks. I backed away. I'm as keen to save pennies as the next wombler, but I'm not willing to risk my life. Or, well. Not life, but: one of the deeper remaining shreds of my pride.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/we-tried-wombling-the-cool-new-trend-where-you-pick-up-peoples-crappy-old-receipts-909-body-image-1455118679-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1088" data-original-height="816" data-model-id="144481" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="we-tried-wombling-the-cool-new-trend-where-you-pick-up-peoples-crappy-old-receipts-909-body-image-1455118679.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>Dejected, I exited the store doing that weird kind of half-smile at the cashiers like I was just really happy to have visited this particular Sainsbury's Local even though I didn't actually buy anything and my behaviour was close to "having a bad trip on Acid" levels of paranoia. But then it struck me: the car parks. Of course. Had I not paid attention to the great womble prophet Stephen Auker at all? I knew there was a Sainsbury's and Matalan car park round the back of a shopping mall nearby so I dived two-footed into its paper-filled bosom.
</p><p>And what a bosom! The suckers out there not in the know about wombling obviously felt like a car park was the best place to dump their scrunched-up gold, and so I really went to town here. But then I saw my colleague had the same idea as me in terms of location and it suddenly became a Supermarket Sweep-esque dash around the place to pick up as many sheets as possible. I actually managed to get quite a few but – though they looked impressively lengthy – most were from Matalan and Iceland, who just seem to enjoy having long receipts with not much penny-saving action going on in them. After weighing up what I'd got online from various stores, I'd reckoned I'd saved just over 45p in total. But for an hour's work in this current climate, not too shabby at all!

</p><h2>AMELIA DIMOLDENBERG, WOMBLER</h2><p>After watching a very tense YouTube video from wombling pioneer Stephen Auker titled, 'Tesco manager approaches me when I'm wombling (E21),' I was rather apprehensive about picking up receipts in close proximity to large corporations. Especially as the first stop on my wombling adventure was a Tesco Express, a notorious death trap for womblers. As I braved the store's interior, sadly the freshly polished lino floor showed no signs of forgotten receipts. They were all stuffed into small black boxes underneath the self-service tills, which are impossible to reach without security seeing. A clever trick. Obviously they have had trouble with womblers before.
</p><p>After a disappointing start, I decided to venture out to a larger supermarket, preferably one with a car park like those I had seen in Stephen's videos. On my way to the bus stop I stumbled across not one, but TWO scrunched-up Tesco Express receipts. Quickly I looked around and checked for any onlookers then placed them in my pocket. Success.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/we-tried-wombling-the-cool-new-trend-where-you-pick-up-peoples-crappy-old-receipts-909-body-image-1455118644-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1088" data-original-height="816" data-model-id="144480" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="we-tried-wombling-the-cool-new-trend-where-you-pick-up-peoples-crappy-old-receipts-909-body-image-1455118644.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>When I finally got to a big Sainsbury's, it was pretty much the same story inside: the floors were spotless, not a receipt to be found. I began to walk out of the main doors, when out of the corner of my eye I spotted another wombler. Slowly, the supermarket morphed into an episode of Blue Planet – "We now see the two womblers meeting for the first time in their natural habitat, and fighting over a receipt to the death." I could tell the man was a wombler because he was rummaging through a line of stationed trolleys with a '£3 off your next shop' voucher in his hand. Annoyingly that voucher was the only good piece of wombler meat in the area and my wombler nemesis had already claimed it. But then in an unforeseen twist of events, like a fool, the man dropped the voucher back onto the trolley and I was poised to take back what was rightfully mine.
</p><p>From then on the game changed. I walked out into the Sainsbury's car park and knew I was playing with the big boys. Running through lines of cars, eyes to the ground, I looked out for my next kill – it's surprising how many pieces of tissue can have the appearance of a receipt.  Top Tip: follow the wind. It will lead you to piles of unwanted receipts that have been swept behind bins and large metal fences, trapped, screaming to get out. I picked up another three receipts from behind the car park fence and called it a day.
</p><p>My wombling adventure was over now over and I was ready to bask in the glory of my success. Disappointingly, I don't know why, but there is something incredibly unsatisfying about making it rain with a handful of muddy receipts. All in all, I'd managed to save a breathtaking 32p. Was it worth it? Was the thrill of the chase worth it? Was clambering to grab the discarded vouchers and receipts of others worth it? For 32p? Do you even need me to answer that question?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whichever way you look at it, initiatives to mitigate the dangers of on-street sex work are going to yield imperfect results – even when they're effective. Because for as long as sex work is criminalised, most meaningful efforts to change things for the better technically have to be made outside of the law.
</p><p>So West Yorkshire Police and Leeds City Council should be lauded for their pioneering scheme, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12094301/Leeds-red-light-district-made-permanent-fixture-with-prostitution-zone-three-weeks-after-sex-worker-murder.html" target="_blank">set up in</a> October of 2014, which allows sex workers to trade without fear of arrest on an industrial estate in Leeds' Holbeck district. The scheme has been credited with making sex workers more likely to report those who prey upon them to the police, and has reduced complaints from fed-up residents.
</p><p>However, three weeks before the initiative was made permanent on the 11th of January this year, 21-year-old sex worker Daria Pionko was murdered within the zone, which operates between 7PM and 7AM and is managed by the authorities. A University of Leeds evaluation carried out before the murder stated that "the perceived decrease in police presence during operational hours is a concern and has contributed to sex workers not experiencing an increase in feeling safer". The report's author, Dr Teela Sanders, made a number of recommendations, including calling for extra policing, better street lighting, CCTV and number plate recognition.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/holbeck-leeds-sex-work-scheme-policing-austerity-body-image-1455135067-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="3000" data-original-height="2000" data-model-id="144621" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="holbeck-leeds-sex-work-scheme-policing-austerity-body-image-1455135067.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>A memorial to Dara Pionko</em>
</p><p>Although West Yorkshire Police are not in any way culpable for Ms Pionko's death, the question remains whether or not policing for sex worker safety within the managed area has been neglected or mismanaged. With other local authorities considering the trailblazing scheme, it would be wise for their police forces to take note of the undoubtedly difficult lessons the managed area in Holbeck has to teach.
</p><p>VICE submitted a Freedom of Information request on the 8th of January to West Yorkshire Police, asking if Dr Sanders' recommendations had been considered and inquiring about the perceived decrease in police numbers. On the 3rd of February the request was delayed for a further 20 days to allow the police to decide whether or not it was in the public interest to release the information.
</p><p>Despite the delay, there is evidence that the managed area has been skimped on. During a Leeds City Council meeting on the 14th of October last year – more than two months before Ms Pionko's death on the 23rd of December – Holbeck Councillor Angela Gabrielspoke out about underfunding generally.
</p><p>At the meeting, Cllr Gabriel said: "Progress has been made. But everybody decided that it was Holbeck's problem and it was going to stay in Holbeck. We have had no resources."
</p><p>Cllr Gabriel declined repeated requests for an interview to discuss the issues she raised in more detail. Her reticence is reflective of the sensitivity of those involved in the managed area, which is being run under the Safer Leeds multiagency partnership and includes local sex worker charities.
</p><p>In many ways the project has been an absolute success: improved trust between sex workers and the police, due to a dedicated liaison officer, has led to an 80 percent increase in offences and attacks being reported, with two rapists being jailed as a direct result of the scheme. The project's partners are all overwhelmingly supportive.
</p><p>That said, when I spoke to a charity outreach worker – who wished to remain anonymous, saying it was not possible to comment openly because of the nature of the partnership – she said that despite "a huge amount of good will" between the partners, one of the underlying reasons for the lack of extra safety provisions was "because we're living in an age of austerity".
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/holbeck-leeds-sex-work-scheme-policing-austerity-body-image-1455135267-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="3000" data-original-height="2000" data-model-id="144622" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="holbeck-leeds-sex-work-scheme-policing-austerity-body-image-1455135267.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>The industrial estate in Leeds' Holbeck district in which sex workers operate </em><em>between 7PM and 7AM </em><em>without fear of arrest.</em>
</p><p>In fact, by this March, Leeds City Council's budget will have been slashed by £180million – a drop of more than 40 percent in five years. West Yorkshire Police are in a similar situation: over 2016 and 2017, their budget will be reduced by more than 30 percent, with extra cuts scheduled for November.
</p><p>In this situation, it's not impossible to envisage hard-pressed decision makers shrinking expenditure through the reduction of police numbers in the Holbeck zone, where the de-facto decriminalisation of the area's ingrained sex industry presents the potential of freeing up the police resources previously used to curb it. Making the possibility of reduced policing more viable is the fact that many sex workers find traditional patrol methods obtrusive anyway.
</p><p>"It's not good for business. I just want to do it and go home. I don't want to mess about with the police. One of the police says to me, 'You're not going to have any fun with that attitude,' and I thought, 'You're taking the piss – as if any of us are having fun down here anyway,'" said 24-year-old Jane (not her real name), who is a heroin addict and has been a street sex worker for two years.

</iframe><p>Jane was waiting to be picked up from the managed area when I visited for a few hours in January, shortly after it was made permanent.
</p><p>"If something bad happens I'll deal with it myself. I don't need to bother with the police. It's just a waste of time. I tell you exactly what it is: girls want to come down here, get their money, go home, get their drugs, go to sleep and do exactly the same the next day until they sort their life out," she said.
</p><p>During my visit police cars passed intermittently and a charity support van was parked up by the side of the road. Early in the evening a police cycle patrol also passed through, though there was no sign of police officers on foot during the time I was there. One of the two officers on the bike patrol informed me that the sex workers don't like having the police around.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/holbeck-leeds-sex-work-scheme-policing-austerity-body-image-1455135796-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="3000" data-original-height="4200" data-model-id="144623" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="holbeck-leeds-sex-work-scheme-policing-austerity-body-image-1455135796.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>"Sarah"</em>
</p><p>This wasn't the case for 32-year-old Sarah (not her real name), who has worked around Holbeck for 15 years "on and off". Sarah was a heroin and crack addict, but has cleaned up and now does sex work to provide for her children.
</p><p>"I've said it for years: there needed to be somewhere where the girls can go, where the guys can go, where it's all contained," she said. "It's been going a while now and it has made things better. The police liaison officer who works with us has been fantastic. There have been more police since Daria's murder, but I think it'll go down again. But there's not much the police can do once you're in someone's car. What we really need is a row of garages with, like, parking meter things and cameras outside. You put your money in, you go in, the shutters come down and you can do your business inside and not have to worry."
</p><p>Dr Sanders hinted at such a solution in her review, asking the authorities to "consider the place where the sexual transaction happens as the place where there is most risk for sex workers. This place is not addressed in the current Managed Area model." Initiatives that solve the problem are already running successfully in Germany, Holland and Switzerland, but are not being considered by Safer Leeds.

</blockquote><p>The problem is that in those countries prostitution is legal and regulated, whereas in Britain it is not. "Unfortunately we're not there yet," commented the charity outreach worker I spoke to. In the absence of legalisation and legislation to govern the industry, the police and their partners will have to think of other ways to unobtrusively protect Holbeck's sex workers that don't result in just leaving them to it.
</p><p>"The managed area is regularly patrolled by officers from the local neighbourhood policing team as part of a specific patrol plan," said a West Yorkshire Police spokesperson, who would not answer my question regarding reduced police presence. "The results of the independent academic evaluation, which includes the recommendations around CCTV, street lighting, etc are currently being reviewed by the Safer Leeds partnership in detail as it continues to look at how the managed area should continue to operate as part of the city's wider strategy around sex work."
</p><p>There is no doubt that policing the managed area is a difficult and delicate undertaking, or that West Yorkshire Police have taken a brave and progressive step by agreeing to do it. Nevertheless, one has to hope that their flagship policy won't be compromised by the need to save money.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">Picture moments before Dublin Weigh in shooting. Madness. <a href="https://t.co/p9GhcyJ8C4">pic.twitter.com/p9GhcyJ8C4</a><br>— Colm (@cohcfc) <a href="https://twitter.com/cohcfc/status/695908831801536513">February 6, 2016</a>
</blockquote><p>A feud between two of Dublin's major criminal families has descended into deadly violence, with both sides taking to the city's streets to settle scores.
</p><p>Last Friday, a six-strong armed gang <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/dublin-boxing-weigh-shooting-hitmen-7320059" target="_blank">rushed a boxing weigh-in</a> at Dublin's Regency Hotel. Wearing Gardai-style rapid response uniforms and armed with two AK-47 rifles, the masked gunmen opened fire on the auditorium, before quickly disappearing into the city. One of their alleged targets, 34-year-old David Byrne, was dead, and two others lay wounded.
</p><p>Since then, police have set up checkpoints around the city, and Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald has called for calm as her government attempts to slow a cycle of violence that is quickly gathering momentum.
</p><p>Initial confusion over who was responsible for the shooting was exacerbated by a statement released after the incident and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35523444" target="_blank">published by the BBC</a>. A man claiming to be a member of dissident group the Continuity IRA (CIRA) said the organisation had carried out the attack and would be targeting more gangland figures. Some local experts were doubtful of the CIRA's involvement in what appeared to be a calculated mob hit, rather than a violent political statement.
</p><p>An <a href="http://www.thejournal.ie/continuity-ira-statements-2592669-Feb2016/" target="_blank">authenticated statement</a> released by the CIRA late on Monday confirmed this suspicion: "The Continuity IRA wish to make it clear that we did not have any involvement in Friday's shooting at the Regency Hotel. We have absolutely no involvement in criminal feuds. We see the false claim that the CIRA were involved in this act as another attempt to tarnish the name of the organisation."
</p><p>Instead, it's believed that a gangland rivalry is to blame.
</p><p>Attending the weigh-in was Daniel Kinahan, son of Christy Kinahan, considered to be <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/who-is-the-kingpin-behind-irish-led-cartel-based-in-spain-1.2525627" target="_blank">Ireland's leading crime boss</a> and the head of an international drug smuggling operation based in Spain's Costa Del Sol. It is thought that Daniel was the intended target of the raid and that the Hutch family – a two-generation Dublin crime dynasty and former allies of the Kinahans – were responsible.
</p><p>The Hutch family became notorious in Ireland after 24-year-old Gerry Hutch was named as a suspect in two of the most lucrative robberies the country had ever seen, the IR£1.7 million robbery of an armoured van in 1987 and the IR£3 million armed robbery of a security depot in 1995. However, Hutch – nicknamed "The Monk" because of his religious beliefs and humble lifestyle – was never prosecuted. Instead, in 2007, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070227155155/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/04/01/current/ipage_7.htm" target="_blank">he paid the Irish government</a> over €1.5 million in "owed" taxes and retired, saying he would be spending his time between Dublin and the Canary Islands.
</p><p>As the younger generation of the Hutch dynasty rose to authority, they gravitated towards the drug trade, working alongside the other major Dublin crime faction, the Kinahans. Gary Hutch, nephew of Gerry Hutch and a convicted armed robber and drug dealer, had even been a housemate and friend of Daniel Kinahan's at one stage – but the alliance wouldn't last.
</p><p>In late 2015, Gary was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/dublin-drugs-shooting-spain-gang-warfare" target="_blank">shot dead</a> in a Spanish apartment complex, reportedly because Christy Kinahan believed he had stolen over €100,000 from the gang while working for them. This was the first time a member of the Hutch family had been targeted in such a way, and it's this incident that is thought to have led to the attempted murder on Friday of Daniel Kinahan and other senior Kinahan gang members. The suspected killer <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/dublin-drugs-shooting-spain-gang-warfare" target="_blank">is known</a> to Garda as an associate of Gerry Hutch.<br><br>
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-O5rDDvVJwU" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="640px" data-original-height="360px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Video footage from the weigh-in attack was still doing the rounds when, on Monday evening at around 7.45PM, 59-year-old father of five <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35526997" target="_blank">Eddie Hutch was gunned down</a> by masked shooters in the hallway of his home on Poplar Row in Dublin's northside.
</p><p>Described as a "quiet man", Eddie was Gerry Hutch's brother. Although he had a record, he had managed to keep away from most major criminal activity and made his living as a taxi driver. However, as the two feuding sides flex their muscle, extended family members and associates have seemingly become fair game. Following Friday's attack, police <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/prime-target-nephew-gangster-eddie-7336191" target="_blank">have moved</a> Gary's brother, Derek Hutch, to the special protection wing at Wheatfield Prison, where he is currently serving time for manslaughter. He's already been the target of attacks within the prison.
</p><p>At a two-hour long <a href="http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/saturation-policing-frances-fitzgerald-to-set-up-new-permanent-armed-response-unit-in-wake-of-gangland-murders-34437507.html" target="_blank">press conference</a> yesterday, Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald and Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan addressed the events, saying: "We will stand down this threat from these gangs, and the garda will have every resource that they need in order to have the kind of armed response that is necessary and the kind of saturation policing that we need to see."
</p><p>Fitzgerald went on to explain that a permanent armed response unit would be created to deal with gangland activity as a direct result of the weekend's murders.
</p><p>It's unlikely that Monday's murder will be the final act of violence in this feud, but the people of Dublin can do little but wait and watch. Meanwhile, the Irish intelligence services are coordinating with Spanish security authorities in an attempt to deal with the situation.
</p><p>A looming election in Ireland will not afford politicians room to manoeuvre past difficult questions, and this current crisis brings the unresolved issue of Ireland's criminal underworld to the fore. The management of Dublin's gangland and maintaining public safety are topics that require action, not posturing, before a civilian is caught in the crossfire.

</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>UK Apache </em>
</p><p>UK Apache, one of the two men behind jungle classic "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzbdBk6XQ6Y" target="_blank">Original Nuttah</a>", is sitting opposite me, reflecting on his upbringing.
</p><p>"I was raised by revolutionary people – my mum and grandparents were heavily involved in the anti-Apartheid struggle, so I was taught to fight for justice and speak the truth," he says. "My grandfather Cassim was in the ANC and friends with Nelson Mandela, and my grandmother Zubeida was Mandela's first secretary – they're in his biography, <em>Long Walk to Freedom</em>."
</p><p>It's a bitter January morning and Apache – real name Abdul Wahab – and I are taking refuge in his friend's restaurant, Khani Halal, on Tooting High Street. I'm here to talk to him about his journey from young "nuttah" to finding peace and purpose in Islam. But, for the moment, he's in full flow remembering his formative years as an only child – of Indian-South African (mum) and Iraqi (dad) parentage – raised by his mother in working class Tooting in the 1970s and 1980s.
</p><p>As a teenager, reggae proved a defining influence.
</p><p>"It was political music and had a positive message, with this talk of the world being in turmoil, sufferance, revolution and fighting for justice. Two of my close friends were Jamaican, and we'd bunk off round each other's houses and listen to Bob Marley, the legend, Papa Michigan, Brigadier Jerry, Dennis Brown and Gregory Isaacs," he recalls.
</p><p>"We'd go youth club on the Doddington Estate in Battersea where there were these sound system dances. I was imitating being a Jamaican – I'd dress like a Jamaican, walk like a Jamaican, talk like a Jamaican, but I wasn't Jamaican; I was a Jafaican," he laughs.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/uk-apache-original-nuttah-islam-reggae-jungle-body-image-1455036231.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="640" data-original-height="797" data-model-id="144072" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="uk-apache-original-nuttah-islam-reggae-jungle-body-image-1455036231.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>A young UK Apache with Nelson Mandela</em>
</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, Britain's black political struggle saw South Asian and African-Caribbean communities unite against violence on the streets, discrimination in the workplace and a fight for rights in the face of a hostile state and its institutions. The struggle's soundtrack was reggae: outsider, anti-establishment music that spoke to disenfranchised youth, whether black, brown or white.
</p><p>Back then, Tooting was a far cry from the melting pot it is today, when a Chicken Shop and the Honest Burger on Tooting High Street stand out as exotic among the succession of South Asian restaurants. Indeed, for a "skinny little Asian kid" like UK Apache, the threat of a kicking was never far away.
</p><p>"South London was rough with the National Front around," he says. "When we moved to Tooting we had things thrown at our house and neighbours called us 'Pakis'. White and black skinheads were out Paki-bashing, and sound system dances weren't welcoming to me – you could get bottled or bricked, and there was this chat: 'Who does he think he is? He thinks he's black.' I was just being who I was, and reggae was a way of talking to the people. All I ever wanted was to make music with a positive message and provide for my mum."
</p><p>By 1990, Apache was making ripples in UK reggae with his debut release "No Poll Tax" and performing with Lord Gelly's Sound at Notting Hill Carnival. But like thousands of other inner city and suburban Londoners at the time, it wasn't long before he turned his attention to jungle.
</p><p>"I instantly felt connected to jungle," he says. "It was British, and as much as I loved reggae, it was Jamaican. Jungle is where my name, UK Apache, came from. In reggae people used to call me Apache – as in Apache Indian – but jungle was UK, so I put UK in front of Apache and it fit like a jigsaw. It seemed god-sent."<br><br>
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dvSo9fj4-z4" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="640px" data-original-height="480px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>UK Apache soon came across the work of a teenage Shy FX, in particular the <em>Goodfellas</em>-sampling "Gangsta Kid", and in 1994 they booked some time in a studio in Victoria. "Original Nuttah" was what emerged, and within months it was in the UK Top 40.
</p><p>Yet, as "Original Nuttah" peaked, UK Apache walked away. Why?
</p><p>"I felt people were trying to cheat me – I was confused and angry and I had no one to trust. It was too much pressure, so I stepped away," he says. "Major labels wanted an album, but it was a total mess – I'd fallen out with everyone. That was the start of my journey into Islam. Initially I was praying, studying and performing 'Nuttah', so I was doing the call to prayer at my masajid  in Tooting. During the day I was doing 'Allahu-Akbar' and at night singing 'na-ni-ni-whoa' – I lived that life for many years."
</p><p>UK Apache may have left the music business behind, but he's aware that "Original Nuttah" is as much of an anthem now as it was in 1994. Taking the vocal melody, he's reimagined it as "I Was a Nuttah", a conscious reggae take on the original, with lyrics reflecting his age and faith.<br><br>

</iframe><p class="photo-credit"><em><br>UK Apache performing a sample of "I Was a Nuttah" for VICE</em>
</p><p>"I wrote 'I Was A Nuttah' because the message of unity, peace and Islam is bigger than me, or any of the negative 'Original Nuttah' stuff. Its message is universal. For example, it talks about respecting youth – youth clubs have closed down, the cost of studying has gone up, the government want young people to be slaves and in debt all their lives. It's madness," he says, shaking his head.
</p><p>It's an especially shaky time for young Muslims in Britain, with political rhetoric and media coverage from certain newspapers making Islam out to be a threat to British values. It's depressingly reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s, when black boys were the boogiemen. Now it's brown boys with beards and brown women in hijabs and niqabs.
</p><p>"Everyone is wondering why British Muslims are joining IS. I believe young Muslims feel alienated and lost, with nothing to hold on to. We all have a part to play – Muslims, non-Muslims, the government and the media who only talk about Muslims in a negative way and never show us in a positive light. Muslims have the biggest part to play – especially mosques, because many are not run in the correct way, and I've experienced it myself. There are imams who are not qualified, because they are not from Britain and they don't speak a word of English. This is a disaster.
</p><p>"Imams should be from Britain so they can relate to youth. If young Muslims don't get the correct understanding of Islam from a mosque or imam, they're going on the internet, where they can get wrong information and be groomed to do acts that are not Islamic."
</p><blockquote><strong><em>READ ON THUMP: <a href="https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/the-inside-story-of-the-best-jungle-labels-youve-probably-never-heard-of" target="_blank">The Inside Story of the Best Jungle Labels You've Probably Never Heard of</a></em></strong>
</blockquote><p>Over the last couple of years, UK Apache's been trying to address the void between elders and youngers by giving talks at mosques.
</p><p>"In my time there weren't many gangs, but there was trouble around drugs and fights, and I've experienced these things," he explains. "Islam guides you in a positive, peaceful manner. It depends on how serious you are, but if you look to Islam it will guide you in the right way. So I've been sharing my experiences and relationship with Islam with the youth, and I always talk about unity and bringing people together."
</p><p>Apache is acutely aware that one of the most effective means of connecting people is music. However, despite recording "I Was A Nuttah", it's far from certain whether or not he'll pursue music – even if it's in a spoken word or <em>nasheed</em> style (without any instruments, bar very basic percussion).
</p><p>"Music is haram, and I don't want to lie because of my own desire. However, if I make the decision to do it, and live properly and well in other respects, that's on my head," he says. "There always seems to be someone who wants to hear 'I Was a Nuttah', and it's been taking on a life of its own. Sometimes these things build over the years. It has a good message, so let's see where it goes and takes me – we'll leave it in the hands of the creator."

</p><p>"It's like we've won the lottery!" yelps a man called Tony, his curly mop of hair jiggling as he gleefully teeters around his council flat like a flicked Subbuteo. He nuzzles into long-term fiancée Diane's grey roots and and exclaims: "You've never seen so much money in your life!"
</p><p>The pair, both stars of Channel 5's new reality show <em>The Great British Benefits Handout (GBBH)</em>, are staring in shock at a briefcase filled with £26,000. Tony and Diane are middle-aged and haven't worked in their adult lives, making up just two of the UK's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31515556">638,000 long-term unemployed</a>. The money is theirs on the proviso that they and their 21-year-old son, a quiet furry boy named Michael, get off the dole. The idea of this "social experiment", we're told, is to see if the family, currently living on £6,000 a year in state benefits, can pull themselves out of worklessness with a sum of money the narrator says "could turn their lives around".</p><span id="docs-internal-guid-2381891d-cae8-d4ab-4bf9-2a0f8c26fef7"><p dir="ltr"><br></p><p dir="ltr">Before the money arrived, they were turned down for every job they applied for. Diane believes this is because they don't look employable and don't have the money to smarten up. It's about more than aesthetics, though; their terraced house is falling apart at its dampened seams and a sense of futility has driven the pair into a deep depression.
</p><p dir="ltr">Channel 5 is here to give the couple, along with two other lucky families, a route out of their reliance on benefits. Opening with shots of endless council estates and David Cameron's party conference speech on how a life of benefits "must be rubbed out", the voiceover declares: "The war on welfare is well and truly on."
</p><p dir="ltr">If we're calling it a war on welfare, then we're used to hearing about "difficult decisions" and "necessary cuts" from the dominant forces. This is the equivalent of a frontline report from the other side, but Tony and Diane's daily drudgery and ennui doesn't make for smart soundbites. So to make for more entertaining viewing, <em>GBBH</em> makes it a game, using three families that easily slot into three <em>Daily Express</em>-defined stereotypes of white British people on benefits: the long-term unemployed, the single mum and the family who have more kids than is deemed necessary (as a third child myself, I'm certainly not saying third and fourth children unnecessary, but it's an ideology cemented in government-enforced policy; any family welcoming in a third child in 2017 will not be eligible for tax credits for them or any subsequent children).</p><p dir="ltr">There's no doubt that a social experiment of this sort <em>could</em> be valuable. Finland is considering give a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/we-asked-an-expert-about-finlands-plan-to-give-every-citizen-800-euros-a-month-800" target="_blank">universal income of 800 euros a month</a> to its citizens and several Dutch cities will roll this out in 2017. The UK has already enacted a version of this policy, by allowing retirees to claim their pension in an upfront sum rather than annuities.<br></p><p dir="ltr">The maximum annual amount the Government will be giving to benefit-claiming households is £26,000,as of this spring, hence the sum received by the families involved. They don't get any advice on how to spend the money, but <em>GBBH</em> has three experts on hand to comment at a distance. There's Honey, a psychologist, Lee, a benefits expert from a financial advice site Income Max, and Professor Guy Standing, who has previously worked on schemes like this with impoverished people in Canada and India, "where no-strings-attached payments have changed lives".</p><p dir="ltr">Every narrative needs an obstacle in the middle, especially in reality TV. In <em>Grand Designs</em>, the concrete-lined extension loses planning permission; in <em>Bake Off</em>, there's a collapsed mousse. But in <em>GBBH </em>the struggle starts at the beginning. These aren't people inventing problems for drama, they're simply trying to live better lives and create workable prospects for their children.</p><p dir="ltr">So initially, Liverpudlian couple Leanne and Scott might seem blasé with their spending. Scott's a trained electrician, but the couple chooses to invest in a raccoon and an inflatable slide for a party-planning business. It might seem careless, but £26,000 won't stretch to much childcare for their mentally disabled son, it at least seems to make sense that they are looking to work from home. </p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile single mum-of-three Rachel's story is much more plain; she celebrates the money with friends at a Chinese buffet, followed by meticulous budget planning so as to settle previous debts. She is emphatic that "the last thing I want to happen is for my kids to go on benefits".</p><p dir="ltr" class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/10/channel-5-great-british-benefits-handout-social-experiment-342-body-image-1455105929.png?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="674" data-original-height="372" data-model-id="144367" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="channel-5-great-british-benefits-handout-social-experiment-342-body-image-1455105929.png" class="vmp-image"></p><p dir="ltr">When <em>Benefits Street</em> came out in 2014, there were complaints that it was exploitative 'poverty porn'. But others felt it was a much-needed look into the lives of people that the Great British Public have so many opinions on, and so little first-hand experience of. However, <em>GBBH</em>'s twist – to televise what is sold as a lottery win – means this show isn't simply a window to a section of society that is underrepresented on television. There is an underlying narrative, which seems to be that these downtrodden guinea pigs must not only appear grateful for their sudden lifestyle change but turn it into gold, despite the high deprivation and job scarcity in the areas where they live. If they are able to make it work, it shows the benefits system was holding them back; if they fail to do so, it shows that even with a lump cash sum, they couldn't amount to anything. </p><p dir="ltr">Either way, you can't help but balk at the tastelessness of turning this into a reality TV format that plays out more like a win-or-lose game than the social experiment it purports to be.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sophwilkinson">@sophwilkinson</a></p><p><strong>More from VICE:</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1" target="_blank"><em>Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income</em></a></p><p><a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/luxury-communism-933" target="_blank"><em>We Don't Need More Austerity: We Need Luxury Communism</em></a></p><p><em><a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/citizens-income-would-it-work-dawn-foster-498" target="_blank">Here's Why the Green Party's 'Citizens Income' Could Make You Even Poorer</a></em><br></p></span>

</p><p>And a leather tourniquet closes around your throat, and your legs – bound to your shoulders with a complex system of pulleys and chains – start to stiffen and cramp, and the blood pools in your genitals and in your brain, and you shudder to one final, magnificent orgasm you and croak: <em>I love you.</em>
</p><p>And wax drips off your nipples and cools on your thighs, and it stings and solidifies and brings up wicked goosepimples on your soft, supple flesh, and edging close to ecstasy you pant: <em>I love you.</em>
</p><p>And hands unseen are whipping at you through the dark, and each of your limbs is bound to a separate nub of the bed, and your body isn't yours anymore, it is scratches and the pink pre-blushes of bruises and the sting of a whip and the red welts of suffering, and you are gristle, euphoric gristle, and you shout to whoever it is that's hurting you, who's pleasuring you: <em>I love you</em>.
</p><p>And you take one delicious breath after the hands are released from around your neck and the bag taken out from over your head and you release that slick, sticky feeling was your entire body being covered in lubricant and you look at what a mess you are, what a dirty little mess you've become, and look up at the light and say: <em>I love you</em>.
</p><p>And you take a sip from a glass of water because every fluid in your body has gushed out of you in a wave and you whisper: <em>I love you</em>.
</p><p>And you glisten and gleam and you are fresh out of the shower and pampered and powdered and swaddled in tight, fresh underwear, and suddenly every single one of your holes is filled at once – every single one, you are yanked and filled like a cushion at a cushion factory – and you yell out as much in surprise as in delight: <em>I love you!</em>
</p><p>And you kneel on the floor and graciously lap it all up and gargle: <em>I love you</em>.

</blockquote><p>Anyway: Valentine's news, now! And it turns out saying "I love you" or talking about love or whatever in bed is actually more erotic, long-term, than wearing fancy lingerie or straight-up foreplay, it says here.
</p><p>That's according to a <a href="https://blogs.chapman.edu/press-room/2016/02/09/chapman-university-researcher-leads-team-to-examine-what-keeps-passion-alive-in-long-term-relationships/" target="_blank">Chapman University</a> study into the sex'n'satisfaction habits of 39,000 married or cohabiting consenting heterosexual adults, anyway,  all of whom had been with their partner for three or more years. So, like: the exact inverse of freaky. The most 'slice of plain white bread with just a smidgen of warm margarine' sex-havers in the universe. Proper 'just tap water is fine, thanks' orgasm-doers. The 'Can we have the lights off, Lynn? And close the curtains. You know I can't rest if we don't close the curtains' of the sex-enjoying world.
</p><p>Anyway, out of them: turns out the more satisfied were the ones who regularly indulged in intimate behaviour, with 75 percent of satisfied men and 74 percent of satisfied women in the study being the ones who regularly said "I love you" or spoke lovingly about love while they had sex. And probably said things like "actually, I prefer spooning to actual intercourse" immediately afterwards. Kind of people who get up early to go to farmer's markets. Dream distantly of living in Downton Abbey times. Take little tupperwares full of seeds and nuts to work to stop them breaking down and just enjoying a dirty, guilty little vending machine Crunchie.
</p><p>That said the phrase was also uttered by 49 percent of dissatisfied men and 44 percent of dissatisfied women, so maybe love truly is a lie.
</p><p>"Almost half of satisfied and dissatisfied couples read sexual self-help books and magazine articles, but what set sexually satisfied couples apart was that they actually tried some of the ideas," said lead study author Dr David Frederick. The study also found 83% of people were sexually satisfied during the first six months of their relationships, and people who sent a teasing little ''''''''''''sext''''''''''' earlier in the day were more likely to be sexually satisfied later on. Also sexual variety was important for overall satisfaction, but analysts couldn't figure out exactly which various sexual flavours were conducive to long term satisfaction – "evidence on the effectiveness of specific forms of variety, such as showering together or wearing lingerie or use of sex toys, is lacking" – so guess you've got to mess around with it a bit.

</blockquote><p>So, thanks to science, this: if you're planning on having some electric, earth-shattering orgasms this Valentine's Day, don't come at them with a dild or a variety pack of intense warming pleasure gels or restraints or frankly appalling DVD footage of someone getting done: instead just drop the L-bomb, right in the middle of the freshly ironed sheets, right before you bark yourself to a climax six minutes after starting. Have a good one, lovers. Have a good one.

</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>A police officer confiscating cannabis plants from a hidden high street farm in Wakefield (Photo: West Yorkshire Police handout)</em>
</p><p>Boarded up, whitewashed and graffiti-covered. No sign of life behind dirty windows. There are vacant ghost shops in every high street in Britain. Retail statistics show that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/16/uk-high-streets-more-shops-close-than-open-net-closures" target="_blank">16 shops are closing every day</a>, most of them mothballed by the recession or beaten into submission by the internet.
</p><p>In the north of England, in towns like Stockport, Burnley, Bolton and Hartlepool, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/04/empty-shop-levels-north-south-england-report" target="_blank">one in five</a> high street shops are empty. Community halls, police stations and working men's clubs also stand abandoned, remnants of an era when local family-run firms weren't being undercut into oblivion by the multinationals.
</p><p>Yet, as these businesses and venues pull down the shutters, a more resilient, recession-proof trade has been stepping into the empty shells they leave behind: illegal cannabis grows.
</p><p>Over the last decade, as the number of shops closing down has risen, so too have the number of cannabis farms discovered hiding behind decaying shop fronts, sucking up electricity and water, inches away from shoppers, <a href="http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14021477.Right_under_their_noses__cannabis_factory_discovered_in_derelict_nightclub_opposite_Sutton_police_station/" target="_blank">police stations</a> and banks. Each bust tells the story of a once thriving business or community asset recycled to become part of Britain's cannabis cultivation industry.
</p><p>At first, these high street cannabis farms appeared to be one-offs, unearthed by chance. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/secret-drug-den-discovered-after-1494002" target="_blank">In 2012</a> a dog walker in Liverpool was passing a vacated African restaurant when her pet Jack Russell decided to urinate against its shutters. The dog owner was startled to see her pet suddenly jolt and drop dead on the pavement.
</p><p>As firemen later learned when they forced their way behind the shutters and into the old restaurant, the upstairs had been turned into a makeshift cannabis farm with 55 plants. Bad wiring, caused by an attempt to bypass the electricity meter, had electrified the shutters and killed the dog.

</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>A cannabis farm found in a former bank in Grimsby (Photo: Humberside Police handout)</em>
</p><p>In the last few years these squatter cannabis farms have been popping up behind an array of vacated high street facades: the <a href="http://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/news/large-scale-cannabis-farm-uncovered-wakefield" target="_blank">Blockbusters in Wakefield</a> and a former <a href="http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Cannabis-operation-tomatoes-man-claimed/story-25409609-detail/story.html#1" target="_blank">Barclays bank in Grimsby</a>; a <a href="http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/town-centre-shop-gutted-by-25678/" target="_blank">pet shop in Folkestone</a>, a <a href="http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/11044074.Cannabis_farm_found_in_Burnley_ex_funeral_parlour/?ref=rss" target="_blank">funeral parlour in Burnley</a>, a <a href="http://www.llanellistar.co.uk/Cannabis-factory-discovered-disused-shop-Stepney/story-18595718-detail/story.html" target="_blank">beauty salon in Llanelli</a> and a <a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/police-porth-follow-noses-sniff-6771356" target="_blank">dog grooming shop in Rhondda</a>.

And most recently, in January, in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-35347479" target="_blank">the old Debenhams building</a> in Derby city centre.
</p><p>You have to feel sorry for the publicans and club owners who've been forced to close their doors because the business of selling legal drugs has failed them, only to see the buildings they vacate being used to grow and distribute illegal drugs. Cannabis grows have been discovered, for example, in shut down pubs in Brockley, Manchester, Merthyr and South Shields and in defunct nightclubs in Bolton, Glamorgan, Sutton, Liverpool and Swansea.
</p><p>It was perhaps not what the Lord our saviour intended, but cannabis farms have been found inside abandoned churches in Edinburgh, Burnley and Morecombe. Grows have also been uncovered in a recently abandoned go-kart complex in Ayr, a leisure centre in Newport, a disused cinema in Nottingham and an NHS mental health centre in Essex.

</blockquote><p>Britain's cannabis cultivation epidemic was originally sparked by the arrival of specialist Vietnamese grow gangs from Canada in the early-2000s. Over the last decade, because of police clampdowns, cannabis cultivation has moved from big grows run by Vietnamese and English gangs in suburbia and rural areas to hard-up individuals getting a crop on in harder to find, smaller grows in urban loft spaces.
</p><p>In 2012, a report by Leeds City Council <a href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/leeds-recession-driving-ordinary-people-into-cannabis-production-exclusive-1-5047681" target="_blank">acknowledged that</a> "the current financial climate may be encouraging certain members of the community to develop their own cottage industry, cultivating small cannabis farms for additional income".
</p><p>And some of these people, either through a tip-off or opportunism, have opted against getting caught with a loft full of plants by hiding cannabis cultivations in plain sight: in empty shops and buildings in their local high street. The only problem with the high street grows is that they are more likely to be discovered, especially if you have no aroma control.
</p><p>One crew of cannabis growers, who had set up a 60-plant farm in an empty high street estate agents in Edinburgh, were forced to start painting the shop front, over and over again, after local shopkeepers began to get suspicious about the curious smell seeping through the whitewashed office windows. After the fifth coat of paint, police raided the farm.
</p><p>A building doesn't even have to be empty. In April last year a large cannabis farm was found in the building that housed Tiki Tots children's nursery in the well-off Edinburgh neighbourhood of Morningside. As the children were playing downstairs, officers discovered nearly 100 plants being nurtured in a room above the nursery.

</iframe><p>Grows have also been set up by shop owners while they are still in business, as a way of keeping the wolf from the door. In 2014, <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/police-uncover-60000-cannabis-farm-7224677" target="_blank">police found a cannabis farm</a> in the back room of a working pub, the Cleveland Arms in Liverpool. The year before, a father and son running a car audio shop in Stockport were rumbled after they <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/reddish-car-shop-was-front-for-family-691705" target="_blank">decided to supplement their income</a> by getting a crop on in the back room and selling weed alongside subwoofers.
</p><p>High street cannabis farms are part of a wider infrastructure in which the drug trade operates, just out of view, in our towns and cities. Scratch the surface, from health shops selling dodgy valium and cab firms serving up to college students, to hairdressers and take-aways selling cocaine and crack, and the drug trade is there. There will be at least one shopfront in every high street that owes its very existence to the drug trade.
</p><p>In Scotland in 2010, for instance, <a href="http://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/nursery-world/news/1094558/organised-crime-probe-targets-nurseries-involved-money-laundering" target="_blank">police raided 12 children's nurseries</a> because they were suspected of being set up for money laundering purposes by organised drug gangs. As a Scotland Yard money laundering expert told me in 2012: "If you want to get large amounts of money to be made to look legitimate, then cash businesses are the way forward. And the best cash businesses are high street stores."
</p><p>But the police are not immune to austerity themselves. They do not have the resources to investigate a seemingly respectable high street shop, or even what might be going on behind the rising numbers of shuttered-up empty stores. Yet as more shops become victim to harsh economic realities, the ever-fluid drug trade – fuelled by unofficial credit, hard cash and catering for an endless demand – will always be there in the background, ready to step in.

</p><p>I sprint the final 20 metres to the car. Somehow, I've managed to escape this Russian military base – in Cuba, not anywhere closer to Moscow. Any guard I encountered, I neutralised using the incredibly subtle tool of a hammer. The game assures me it's non-lethal. Sure, a fractured skull almost certainly poses zero risk to anyone's life. At least, this is what I've been telling myself each time I've lured an enemy down a dark corridor for a thump to the temple.
</p><p>"That was funny, but you'll never get away with it in Paris," smirks one of the Square Enix staff walking around the <em>Hitman</em> preview event I'm at, their steady patrolling making them seem like guards of a different sort. Guards I <em>shouldn't</em> whack with a hammer.
</p><p>But I'm delaying on answering the big question here, hanging above the heads of every Hitman fan: does this new entry in IO Interactive's long-running stealth-murder series feel anything like the beloved <em>Hitman: Blood Money </em>of 2006? Or, at least, <em>not</em> so much like the maligned <em>Hitman: Absolution</em> that came out six years later and is, iOS titles aside, the immediate predecessor to this forthcoming entry?
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3O1DnIyhA3I" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="560px" data-original-height="315px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="photo-credit">'Hitman', beta launch trailer
</p><p>The answer is that <em>Hitman</em>, 2016 version, is somewhere between the two points, but a lot closer to <em>Blood Money </em>than <em>Absolution</em>. It features the next-gen polish that we saw in <em>Absolution</em>, while the large levels filled with flexible opportunities for sneaky kills return from <em>Blood Money</em>, albeit with a whole lot more non-player characters to interact with. The three areas I explore are thriving with life, some of which to talk to, some of which to take away. The two-part tutorial begins with a boat party before our quiet protagonist, Agent 47, finds himself at the aforementioned base. Later, the first mission proper turns you loose at a Parisian fashion show, complete with dodgy meetings going on in secret rooms.
</p><p>Each area is teeming with hostiles, weapons to improvise, opportunities for kills – and potential witnesses. And if they see so much as the slightest shadow of your misdeeds, you'll need to take care of them. Suffice to say that while learning the art of the hit, I had to stuff a dozen and more bodies into a side room before stalking off into the night, whistling a jaunty tune and wearing the clothes of the last guard I killed. Who was, conveniently and just like every other male in the game, <em>exactly</em> my size.
</p><p>The gunplay in <em>Hitman</em> feels fine – an armed Agent 47 is more than a match for a room full of guards, which makes total sense considering you're a genetically engineered killing machine. But fighting in this fashion is only ever a war of attrition. There's only one of you, and every round chips away at 47's health. There are, however, absolutely loads of <em>them</em>. However many guards you drop with a headshot, they will just keep coming.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/the-new-hitman-game-may-prove-to-be-the-pinnacle-of-the-series-123-body-image-1455103938-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1440" data-original-height="810" data-model-id="144324" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="the-new-hitman-game-may-prove-to-be-the-pinnacle-of-the-series-123-body-image-1455103938.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>The Hitman games have always been tough: pulling off the perfect hit takes plenty of practise, nerves of steel and often a little bit of luck. But that final factor's always been a big part of the series' charm. It makes those flawless assassinations feel all the better, like fate was as much on your side as thorough preparation.
</p><p>Everything gels immediately in the new <em>Hitman</em>. The tutorial shows you Agent 47's training montage within the International Contract Agency (ICA), and the shadowy assassination broker that he works for/against through the series. Within seconds you choke out a poor crewmember near the party boat and slip into his outfit. "We've not seen anything like that before," remarks Diana Burnwood, 47's long-term handler. I guess 47's been into role-play since before he joined ICA.
</p><p>The boat feels claustrophobic and tense, but it's a perfect location to show off the way playing dress up works in 2016. Disguises have always been an awkward element of the Hitman series, hard to introduce into any stage while ensuring they make enough thematic sense. There's no risk of dissonance this time, though: wearing the uniform of a guard gives 47 his privileges, unless you run into one of that (now, at least, incapacitated) guard's closest work colleagues, or the security supervisor, who knows his entire team personally. And this will probably happen – the crew of the target-owned boat is small, each guard knowing the next, so it's vital to not linger too long in anyone's sight.

</iframe><p>You can avoid suspicion by keeping your distance from other guards. Get your head down if they're passing nearby. Wipe down a table; look like you're supposed to be there. It's a constant challenge – just putting on someone else's clothes isn't enough to prevent detection in <em>Hitman</em>. You have to <em>act</em> the part, too.
</p><p>The second part of the tutorial sees you throw down with the Russian military. While I pick up a hammer for the blunt approach, the journalist playing next to me manages their hit with perfect stealth, slipping in and out of the hot zone like a whisper.
</p><p>Little did I know, slyly watching his silent entry to the facility, that he had a master plan. The second tutorial – in addition to introducing enemies with some firepower on their side – is all about the game's opportunities system, a new addition for 2016. Overhearing two guards discussing the fighter jet that'll be used to fly out the Soviet spy you're here to assassinate gives you an inventive new way to take down the mole. With a bit of prodding, and a lot of sneaking, you can sabotage the jet's ejector seat and splatter your target when it triggers prematurely.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/the-new-hitman-game-may-prove-to-be-the-pinnacle-of-the-series-123-body-image-1455103996-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1440" data-original-height="810" data-model-id="144325" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="the-new-hitman-game-may-prove-to-be-the-pinnacle-of-the-series-123-body-image-1455103996.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>These sorts of kills have long been a hallmark of the Hitman series, with perhaps the most infamous being the switching of a prop gun for the real deal during <em>Blood Money</em>'s "Curtains Down" opera level. The difference here is that several of them are available in any single scenario. Talking about too many of them would ruin the surprise, but when you move into Paris there are a number of options open to particularly creative players. You might, for example, want to note that Agent 47 is the spitting image of a world-famous supermodel rumoured to be walking the catwalk at today's fashion show.
</p><p>There is a wealth of positives to embrace about the new <em>Hitman</em>, then; but with the base game – the tutorials and Paris, with further missions available episodically – released just weeks away from the time of writing, on March 11th, I have some concerns. During my preview session with <em>Hitman</em>, it crashed ten times in three hours. The beta, which starts on February 12th, might allay performance fears – hopefully, what I played was a version several tweaks ahead of what the public is about to get its hands on. Perhaps more pertinently, there's the question of longevity: is there enough to do in this game? Will one level proper be enough to keep people content until the next batch of missions becomes available? Square Enix are gambling on yes – and the inclusion of a few extra modes might be reason enough to back their corner.
</p><blockquote><strong>New on Munchies: </strong><a href="https://munchies.vice.com/en/videos/sex-food-boner-constrictor" target="_blank"><strong>Snakes on a Plate</strong></a>
</blockquote><p>The Contracts mode from <em>Absolution</em> returns for 2016's <em>Hitman</em>. Square Enix have revealed that 30 million contracts have been played to date on Absolution, so they're bringing it back. The basic structure hasn't changed: carry out a hit and then upload your efforts so that online friends and strangers alike can either replicate them or, better yet, improve upon your best. What's different is the scope of the mode – 300 "fully simulated" NPCs populate each Contract stage, all of which have their individual routines, ready to either interrupt your progress or become an essential cog of it. Either way, horrible, horrible murder is the likely result.
</p><p>Escalation contracts are included, too. These are similar to the Contracts missions, but they're hand designed by the team at IO Interactive. They slowly escalate in difficulty by adding more and more problems to the mix every time you beat a scenario. This led to running someone down in the middle of a hall with an ancient cavalry sabre, so expect similarly ridiculous antics when you play the game yourself.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/the-new-hitman-game-may-prove-to-be-the-pinnacle-of-the-series-123-body-image-1455104050-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1440" data-original-height="810" data-model-id="144327" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="the-new-hitman-game-may-prove-to-be-the-pinnacle-of-the-series-123-body-image-1455104050.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>Finally, there are the Elusive Targets challenges. This is what I'm most excited by – time-limited targets who will come online for just a few hours, in real time, with players getting just one chance to take them down. If you kill them, they're dead, obviously; but if they escape, that's it. You don't get a second chance to make a first impression, as they say. And finding these targets is going to be tricky – each has their own backstory, but the player will receive just a few cryptic clues on how to find them. Players will be skulking around looking for hints and listening into conversations if they want to find the target, and I can see this mode appealing massively to Hitman perfectionists.
</p><p>At its best, <em>Hitman</em> 2016 is the pinnacle of what any game in this series should be. It's incredibly polished, and when everything clicks into place, and you strike down your target having laid out the most incredible plot ahead of that moment, it's just so much fun. But its drip-fed digital release model is a risk, and its pricing a little confusing – you get access to everything for your standard $60 (about £45 in the UK), but breaking the full game down into its components can see that price rise, and it's actually <em>marginally</em> cheaper to buy further episodes individually than as an "upgrade pack" complete bunch of five. A disc version including (presumably) everything won't come out until much later in 2016.
</p><p>I'm not wholly convinced that the loyal Hitman audience of old will be up for playing the new game piecemeal, but the beta is likely to separate those who are ready to go right now from others who'll wait for the physical package. I'll be playing the beta at home, I know that much, and if the idea of <em>getting away with murder</em> appeals to you, I recommend you do the same.
</p><p>Hitman<em> is released on March 11th, with its beta beginning on February 12th – check the <a href="https://hitman.com" target="_blank">game's official website</a> for more information. </em>

Doctors, farmers, lawyers, civil servants, even policemen – <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-04/greek-pension-reform-sparks-strike-as-heat-turned-up-on-tsipras" target="_blank">everyone is demonstrating</a> against an overhaul of the country's pension system demanded by international lenders and imposed by the local Left-wing government.</p><p>Everyone, except the 4,000 people who turned up at Athens' Propylaia earlier this week. These guys were protesting the new Greek ID cards, which will come with a microchip carrying the holder's NI number. But as it turns out microchips and NI numbers are instruments of the devil - at least according to the country's Christian Orthodox fanatics, conspiracy theorists and thriving far-right community. So those brave few got together to protest in the city centre, holding religious icons and Greek flags.</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/antichrist-new-greek-id-cards-protest-876-body-image-1455057537-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1000" data-original-height="662" data-model-id="144170" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="antichrist-new-greek-id-cards-protest-876-body-image-1455057537.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p>I decided I should try and talk to a few of them. The first person I approached – a tall nervous man in his forties called Anthony – told me that if we tolerate microchips in our ID cards, in a few years Greeks will need chips implanted under their skin in order to get into supermarkets. The second – a lady from the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki who was attending the demo with her husband and her son – took time out of her day to explain to me why all journalists are slaves to Satan. A third gave me an impassioned speech about how the New World Order will soon demand that we all type our phone numbers into cash machines if we want to get any money out. Which isn't that scary.</p><p>In short, it all felt as if a few thousand YouTube comments had suddenly come to life and decided to take a stroll around Athens on a sunny Sunday afternoon.</p><p> See for yourself in the photos below. </p>

</p><p><em>YouTube is probably the greatest anthropological project ever launched. It has managed to expose the multitudes of the human condition more than any other medium ever created, and allowed people to express themselves in more diverse ways than at any point in history. This weekly column is an outlet for me to share with you some undiscovered gems, as well some very well-trodden gems, and discuss just what it is that makes the chosen accounts so intriguing.</em>
</p><p><strong>WHO:</strong> Jay Cooper<br><strong>WHAT:</strong> Archive of old adverts and TV moments.<br><strong>HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS AT TIME OF WRITING:</strong> 822<br><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE:</strong> A couple of weeks ago we talked about <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/youtube-channel-of-the-week-number-six-214" target="_blank">SilverDrizzle and Qadoshezkaton</a>, two channels that have taken it upon themselves to document and share two very different types of music (grime and what I can only really describe as "agony metal"). This week's edition looks at another kind of archival channel, the difference being it's based around things that are found and, more to the point, visual.
</p><p>Jay Cooper is an American man who uploads ripped VHS tape to his channel, which is also called Jay Cooper. The clips are mostly newscasts, advertisements and, strangely, footage of the funerals of British monarchy. But we'll get back to those later.<br><br>
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7o8PNh_ryIc" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="420px" data-original-height="315px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Let's start with the newscasts. Jay Cooper has uploaded – among others, of course – a news report from 1989 on WHO, a local news station in Des Moines, Iowa. The report features a non-fatal double stabbing, a potential accidental arson from a two-year-old who burnt their sibling and the rush for Thanksgiving groceries. They also talk about President Bush (senior) urging Gorbachev to "work with him" at a summit in Malta; the death of the Lebanese President in a bomb attack; and a cover story about career women.
</p><p>The larger, international stories are par for the course, but there's something eerie about the dark local news. A woman found in her front garden, throat slashed, stabbed multiple times. A clearly shaken police chief giving an interview, his strange, low-definition head looming sadly in the pitch black darkness. There is an odd, broken hum about it, the grimness captured the way it will always remain for the people involved.<br><br>
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UeVXmd4v1Eo" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="420px" data-original-height="315px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Jay Cooper sadly hasn't got any really old-school ads on his channel, but he does have these promo compilations from HBO. These days, HBO is seen as the most progressive, modern TV network going, having been home to some incredibly groundbreaking shows, like <em>Oz</em> and <em>The Sopranos</em>. But even a station as sleek and "cool" as HBO clearly isn't exempt from the chintzy-ness of the early-90s, in the form of a growling, whisky-soaked purr of a sleazebag advertising the 1992 <em>Sports Illustrated</em> swimsuit edition.
</p><p>By far the strangest and most compelling thing on Jay Cooper's channel, though, are the multiple-hour-long videos of funerals and depositions. If you were so inclined, you could go to his channel and watch all five and a half hours of CNN's coverage of the funeral of Princess Diana. The horse-drawn procession of her coffin, ambling by as thousands of people look on, on a sunny September day. Her children having to walk behind the casket holding their dead mother in front of millions of people. The clop of the horses only interrupted by the solemn commentary of the news anchor. A speech and a poem reading by Tony Blair. And, of course, the performance of "Candle in the Wind", the only time it has ever been performed, by Elton John, to a throng of weeping onlookers. A furiously bizarre time captured in its entirety, viewed over 300,000 times by people who comment bemoaning her passing, calling her a beautiful angel.<br><br>

A man in the most powerful seat of governance in the world, sat in a room, being questioned about his alleged inappropriate relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The camera focused completely on his face for almost the entirety of the video, every concerned expression he musters, every time he plays with his glasses, the blank stare of trying not to appear guilty. The president on view for all to see, being asked questions about vaginal intercourse.<br><br>

It is important we have these to watch. It's good to learn from them. In the future, should we make a dead princess's children walk down the middle of a road behind her, flanked by soldiers while people with Boyzone haircuts take photos? I'm not so sure.
</p><p>As pleasant as it is to remember what TV was like back in the day, we should remember that the darker side of it – the hysteria of tragedy – is probably best kept under wraps.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/toronto-politician-asks-whether-canada-should-ban-beyonce-body-image-1455047294.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="960" data-original-height="640" data-model-id="144139" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="toronto-politician-asks-whether-canada-should-ban-beyonce-body-image-1455047294.jpg" class="vmp-image"><br>A performance apparently befitting of a freakout by a Toronto city councillor. Photo via Facebook</p><p dir="ltr">Does Jimmy K want Canada to block Bey?
</p><p dir="ltr">That's a possibility he raised with the <em>Toronto Sun</em> on Tuesday.
</p><p dir="ltr">Jim Karygiannis, Toronto city councillor, former member of parliament, and all-around plain-spoken guy, told the tabloid on Tuesday that the Trudeau government should investigate ties between Beyoncé—and her Super Bowl backup dancers—and the Black Panther Party.
</p><p dir="ltr">And while it might seem ridiculous to suggest that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) should turn Beyoncé Knowles-Carter away at the border, well, it is.
</p><p dir="ltr">Beyoncé is slated to perform in Toronto on May 25, but after her Super Bowl halftime performance—which, on top of being the best, gave shout-outs to the Black Panthers and Malcolm X—the city councillor says the federal government should be vetting whether or not she's eligible to enter the country.
</p><p dir="ltr">"Perhaps Immigration Minister John McCallum should have her investigated first?" <a href="http://m.torontosun.com/2016/02/08/beyonces-political-halftime-show-draws-fire" target="_blank">Karygiannis told <em>Sun</em> columnist/Rob Ford apologist Joe Warmington</a>, who is very good at transcribing interviews with city councillors he likes. "If someone wore bullets and supported  here, they would not be welcomed in the United States—that's for sure."
</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, he said, "she or some of them  could be found not eligible to enter the country as others in the past have faced," adding that it's wrong for the pop star to be advancing "gun culture or anti-police sentiments."
</p><p dir="ltr">VICE reached out to the councillor to find out what the hell he was talking about.
</p><p dir="ltr">"Look, if there's questions, have Minister MacCallum investigative," Karygiannis said. "People are offended by it... and if people are offended by it, call the minister."
</p><p dir="ltr">Despite telling the<em> Sun</em> that her performance was "disturbing," Karygiannis says he has no problem with the performer: "I don't care whether she comes, she doesn't come. I don't care."
</p><p dir="ltr">But, at the same time, Karygiannis kept reiterating that people should pass their complaints onto the federal government and ask it to investigate. "If people are offended with what's she's wearing,  is where it should be addressed. If you're offended by it, don't let her in."
</p><p dir="ltr">Lots of people hated Bey's performance, of course. New York mascot Rudy Giuliani <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/beyonce-halftime-show-draws-ire-praise-article-1.2524039" target="_blank">ranted about how it's anti-cop</a>, and proceeded to tell America's black population what it should be doing,
</p><p dir="ltr">But nobody raised the idea of banning Beyoncé from the country, especially because that's not even remotely how Canadian law works.
</p><p dir="ltr">Let's go through the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/ivc-rnc-eng.html#a3a" target="_blank">CBSA's checklist</a> of how someone can be denied entry to Canada:
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Security"</strong>—Unless you consider her ass to be dynamite, I don't think national security applies.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Human or international rights violations"</strong>—While she did slay at the Super Bowl, there were no reported casualties.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Criminality"</strong>—Jay Z once stabbed a guy in the stomach and <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1450090/jay-z-pleads-guilty-to-stabbing-faces-three-years-probation/" target="_blank">spent three years</a> on probation. But that's his problem.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Organized criminality"</strong>—Destiny's Child does not sound like a very good gang.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Health grounds"</strong>—She looks healthy to me.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Financial reasons"</strong>—Maybe she has too much money?
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Misrepresentation"</strong>—"Listen, Mrs. Beyoncé, you need to put your last name on the form."
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>"Having an inadmissible family member"</strong>—I think we can all get behind banning Jay Z from Canada for his <a href="https://vimeo.com/26606636" target="_blank">verse on "Monster</a>."</p><p dir="ltr">I cannot find "being offended," "wearing a bullet sash," or "making Chris Martin look stupid" anywhere on the CBSA website.
</p><p dir="ltr">And while Canada has a long history in barring would-be entrants at the border, there are generally pretty good reasons.
</p><p dir="ltr">Chris Brown, for one, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/chris-brown-denied-entry-to-canada-before-toronto-montreal-shows-1.2970087" target="_blank">got turned away en route to a show in Montreal</a>, probably due to his criminal record. Emo band the Used (a.k.a. the poor man's My Chemical Romance) had a similar experience thanks to some <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-used-barred-from-touring-in-canada-20120622" target="_blank">decade-old misdemeanors</a>. Rapper Danny Brown was also <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/52223-danny-brown-denied-entry-into-canada/" target="_blank">denied</a> en route to tour dates in western Canada.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This piece was published in partnership with <a href="http://theinfluence.org/" target="_blank">The Influence</a>.</em></p><p>The long subway ride from DC's airport to Silver Spring was unusually pleasant. It had been about an hour since I had taken a low dose of methamphetamine. It was my 40th birthday—October 30, 2006—and I was headed to a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-sponsored meeting.</p><p>A friend, who had a prescription for the drug, had given me a couple of pills as a gift, knowing that I was an expert on amphetamines but had never actually taken any myself. I sat on the train feeling alert, mentally stimulated, and euphorically serene.</p><p>And when the effects had worn off after a few hours, I thought, <em>that was nice</em>, worked out, and enjoyed a productive two-day meeting. Well, maybe not enjoyed—it was a NIDA meeting after all. But I didn't crave the drug or feel the need to take any more. I certainly didn't engage in any unusual behaviors—hardly the stereotypical picture of a "meth head."</p><p>So why is it, then, that the general public has such a radically different view of this drug?</p><p>Perhaps it has something to do with public "educational" campaigns aimed at discouraging methamphetamine use. These campaigns usually show, in graphic and horrifying detail, some poor young person who uses the drug for the first time and then ends up engaging in uncharacteristic acts such as prostitution, stealing from parents, or assaulting strangers for money to buy the drug. At the end of the advertisement, emblazoned on the screen, is: "Meth—not even once." We've also seen those infamous "meth mouth" images (extreme tooth decay), <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/methamphetamine-dangers-exaggerated-20140218.pdf" target="_blank">wrongly presented</a> as a direct consequence of methamphetamine use.</p><p>These types of media campaigns neither prevent nor decrease the use of the drug; nor do they provide any real facts about the effects of meth. They succeed only in perpetuating false assumptions.</p><p>Swayed by this messaging, the public remains almost entirely ignorant of the fact that methamphetamine produces nearly identical effects to those produced by the popular ADHD medication d-amphetamine (dextroamphetamine). You probably know it as Adderall®: a combination of amphetamine and d-amphetamine mixed salts.</p><p>Yeah, I know. This statement requires some defense.</p><p>This is not to suggest that people who are currently prescribed Adderall should discontinue its use for fear of inevitable ruinous addiction, but instead that we should view methamphetamine rather more like we view d-amphetamine. Remember that methamphetamine and d-amphetamine are both FDA-approved medications to treat ADHD. In addition, methamphetamine is approved to treat obesity and d-amphetamine to treat narcolepsy.</p><p>In the interest of full disclosure, I too once believed that methamphetamine was far more dangerous than d-amphetamine, despite the fact that the chemical structure of the two drugs is nearly identical (see figure). In the late 1990s, when I was a PhD student, I was told—and I fully believed—that the addition of the methyl group to methamphetamine made it more lipid-soluble (translation: able to enter the brain more rapidly) and therefore more addictive than d-amphetamine.</p><p>It wasn't until several years after graduate school that this belief was shattered by evidence—not only from my own research, but also by results from research conducted by other scientists.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475187/" target="_blank">our study</a>, we brought 13 men who regularly used methamphetamine into the lab. We  gave each of them a hit of methamphetamine, of d-amphetamine, or of placebo on separate days under double-blind conditions. We repeated this many times with each person over several days and multiple doses of each drug.</p><p>Like d-amphetamine, methamphetamine increased our subjects' energy and enhanced their ability to focus and concentrate; it also reduced subjective feelings of tiredness and the cognitive disruptions typically brought about by fatigue and/or sleep deprivation. Both drugs increased blood pressure and the rate at which the heart beat. No doubt these are the effects that justify the continued use of d-amphetamine by several nations' militaries, including our own.</p><p>And when offered an opportunity to choose either the drugs or varying amounts of money, our subjects chose to take d-amphetamine on a similar number of occasions as they chose to take methamphetamine. These regular methamphetamine users could not distinguish between the two. (It is possible that the methyl group enhances methamphetamine's lipid-solubility, but this effect appears to be imperceptible to human consumers.)</p><p>It is also true that the effects of smoking methamphetamine are more intense than those of swallowing a pill containing d-amphetamine. But that increased intensity is due to the route of administration, not the drug itself. Smoking d-amphetamine produces nearly identical intense effects as smoking methamphetamine. The same would be true if the drugs were snorted.</p><p>As I left DC and traveled home to New York, I reflected on how I had previously participated in misleading the public by hyping the dangers of methamphetamine. For example, in one of my earlier studies, aimed at documenting the powerfully addictive nature of the drug, I found that when given a choice between taking a small hit of meth (10 mg) or one dollar in cash, methamphetamine users chose the drug about half the time.</p><p>For me, in 2001, this suggested that the drug was addictive. But what it really showed was my own ignorance and bias. Because, as I found out in a later study, if I had increased the cash amount to as little as five dollars, the users would have taken the money almost all of the time—even though they knew they would have to wait several weeks until the end of the study before getting the cash.</p><p>All of this should serve as a lesson on how media distortions can influence even scientific knowledge about the consequences of drug use.</p><p>It took me nearly 20 years and dozens of scientific publications in the area of drug use to recognize my own biases around methamphetamine. I can only hope that you don't require as much time and scientific activity in order to understand that the Adderall that you or your loved one takes each day is essentially the same drug as meth.</p><p>And I hope that this knowledge engenders less judgment of people who use meth, and greater empathy.</p><p><em>Dr. Carl L.

</p><p class="photo-credit">A screenshot from 'Political Machine 2016', via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s4vo1iEn7Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
</p><p>Sometimes, it feels like video games can predict the future. Electronic Arts' Madden NFL series has <a href="https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl/news/2016/madden-prediction-history" target="_blank">a pretty good track record</a> when it comes to selecting Super Bowl winners. Back in 1992, Randy Chase's strategy game <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Politics_(video_game)" target="_blank">Power Politics</a> </em>made Associated Press headlines when it correctly predicted that Bill Clinton would be the next President of the United States.
</p><p><em>Power Politics </em>wasn't the first presidential election simulator – that's probably 1981's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Elect_(video_game)" target="_blank">President Elect</a></em> – but it was the most advanced, and early 1990s political analysts were impressed by the game's depth and attention to detail. <em>Power Politics</em> has proved remarkably robust, too. Twenty-four years after the game debuted, presidential simulators still follow <em>Power Politics</em>' basic template. The candidates may have changed, but the rules remain largely the same.
</p><p>Election simulators turn the presidential election into turn-based strategy games, giving armchair campaign managers the chance to guide their favourite candidates to victory. Usually, every candidate act simultaneously, and players must anticipate their opponents' next moves while also juggling their limited resources. There's a time limit, too. Players need to sway as many voters to their side as possible before Election Day, when the computer tallies up the electoral votes and declares a winner.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/10/weve-used-video-games-to-predict-the-next-president-of-the-united-states-900-body-image-1455095135.png?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="945" data-original-height="679" data-model-id="144252" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="weve-used-video-games-to-predict-the-next-president-of-the-united-states-900-body-image-1455095135.png" class="vmp-image">

</p><p>Not every election game is created equal, of course. For example, only one of this year's major election simulators, <em><a href="http://270soft.com/us-election-games/president-election-game-2016-infinity/" target="_blank">President Infinity</a></em>, includes the crucial primary elections. In the wake of <a href="https://www.vice.com/tag/iowa+caucus+2016" target="_blank">the Iowa Caucus</a>, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are all viable Republican candidates, and this November's presidential election will unfold very differently depending on who walks out of the Republican National Convention with the GOP nomination in July.
</p><p>Spiritually, <em>President Infinity</em> is <em>Power Politics</em>' closest successor, offering a complicated and thorough simulation with all the visual panache of an Excel spreadsheet. In some ways, <em>President Infinity </em>offers <em>too much</em> detail: you'll have to plan your travel itinerary, schedule speeches, prepare for debates and manage your advertisements. Everything costs money, so you'll need to fundraise to stay competitive. You also need to manage an in-game currency called Political Capital, which can be used to buy surrogates who will campaign on your behalf as well as important third-party endorsements.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/weve-used-video-games-to-predict-the-next-president-of-the-united-states-900-body-image-1455095212-size_1000.png?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1252" data-original-height="662" data-model-id="144253" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/10/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/10/" data-image-filename="weve-used-video-games-to-predict-the-next-president-of-the-united-states-900-body-image-1455095212.png" class="vmp-image">

</p><p>None of these actions affect voters directly. Instead, everything you and your opponents do changes candidates' momentum. When momentum's high, you'll win supporters. When it's low, you'll lose them. You can change your opponents' momentum by attacking them in ads or during public appearances, but if your campaign is too negative, that can backfire. On top of all of this, your candidate has a stamina meter. When that runs out, you'll need to let them rest.
</p><p>That's a lot to pay attention to. Thankfully, there's also a way to make <em>President Infinity </em>play itself. Simply choose a candidate with very little money and no name value – someone without a Wikipedia page is a safe option – and don't take any actions during your turn. The CPU-controlled frontrunners will duke it out amongst themselves, leaving you free to watch the action.
</p><p>On the Democrats' side, <em>President Infinity</em>'s primaries don't get too interesting. Over the course of the 11 simulations I ran, Hillary Clinton only lost the nomination twice – to Vice President Joe Biden, who's not running in real life. Sorry, Bernie fans: <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders-conquered-the-new-hampshire-primaries" target="_blank">despite his New Hampshire success</a>, according to <em>President Infinity</em>, Sanders doesn't stand a chance.

In fact, after ten simulations, the Republican card was caught in a five-way tie: Trump, Rubio, Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush all scored two nominations. It took a tie-breaking 11th run to crown Marco Rubio the Republican candidate for President of the United States, and even then, Fiorina gave him a run for his money.
</p><p>In the ensuing Clinton versus Rubio battle, <em>President Infinity</em> predicts a Rubio win three out of five times. On one run, Rubio won the popular vote, but Clinton walked away with the presidency. In two others, Election Day polls predicted a Clinton victory, only for Rubio to emerge the winner (as in real life, <em>President Infinity</em>'s polling isn't entirely accurate). It's going to be a close race, but according to <em>President Infinity</em>, Marco Rubio will be America's next president.
</p><p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Machine_2016" target="_blank">The Political Machine 2016</a></em>, another election simulator, disagrees. The Political Machine is simpler and more polished than <em>President Infinity</em>. <em>The Political Machine </em>has a friendly, responsive user interface, and players' actions – delivering speeches, deploying advertisements and building regional campaign headquarters – have a direct effect on states' electorates. There's none of this "momentum" stuff. Your actions either win voters or they don't.

</p><p><em>The Political Machine</em> is also the only election game that asks players to take a stand on the issues. In most games, <em>President Infinity</em> included, you can choose the topics of your speeches, but you don't actually choose a position. In <em>The Political Machine</em>, you'll need to advocate policy that both appeals to undecided voters and also won't piss off your own party. That's not as easy as it sounds.
</p><p>In six different games of <em>The Political Machine</em>, Clinton won the White House four times – twice when I controlled her, and twice when I managed Rubio. That makes sense: in<em> The Political Machine</em>, the deck is stacked in Clinton's favour from the beginning. Clinton has higher stamina and fundraising ratings than Rubio and starts the game with more money. Basically, Clinton can get stuff done faster and more efficiently. That's a big advantage in <em>The Political Machine</em> – and not a bad quality for a president, either.
</p><blockquote><strong>New on Noisey: </strong><a href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/presidential-candidate-metal" target="_blank"><strong>How Will Your Vote Affect the Future of Metal?</strong></a>
</blockquote><p>That's one game for Rubio, and one for Clinton. So can the mobile title<em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinbradford.games.campaign&hl=en" target="_blank">Campaign Manager</a></em> break the deadlock? As it turns out, not really.  <em>Campaign Manager</em> only lets players take a few actions: you can create advertisements, mount a ground campaign and hire volunteers. That's it. There's just one currency, money, which is replenished by tapping on dollar signs that appear during the game. Both candidates start with the same amount of cash in the bank, and nobody has an advantage.
</p><p><em>Campaign Manager</em> is too simple to use as a predictive tool – generally, whoever the player is controlling wins. But by stripping an election simulator down to its base components, <em>Campaign Manager</em> reveals a common philosophy that all these games share. In election games, the presidential race isn't a clash of ideologies or personalities. It's a contest to see who can manage their resources most effectively. What a candidate says doesn't matter as much how and when they say it. Votes aren't earned, they're bought and sold.
</p><p>In other words, when it comes to who's really going to win the White House later this year, video games provide us with only one clear answer: whoever is willing to pay the most for it.

</p><p>It's not easy being woke. Johnny Depp's 16-year-old daughter Lily Rose Depp tried to come out as a queer ally recently and accidentally just came out. She took part in an LGBT+ outreach project and said her sexuality fell somewhere on a "vast spectrum" which many took to mean she was announcing her sexuality. She has since come in again, <a href="http://www.out.com/popnography/2016/2/03/lily-rose-depp-responds-being-labeled-queer">to say she was doing the exact opposite</a>: "I was literally doing it just to say that you don't have to label your sexuality; so many kids these days are not labelling their sexuality and I think that's so cool."
</p><p>Rose-Depp's fingers might be burnt, but she's far from the only young celebrity dipping their toe into queer issues: Jaden Smith became the face for Louis Vuitton womenswear in January and now Instagrams photos of himself wearing dresses and standing on fire hydrants.

<title>Why Talk Radio Needs George Galloway</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/george-galloway-return-talk-sport-body-image-1455027920.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="800" data-original-height="535" data-model-id="144005" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="george-galloway-return-talk-sport-body-image-1455027920.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit"><em>(Photo by David Hunt <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Galloway_2007-02-24.jpg" target="_blank">via</a>)</em>
</p><p>You might think "talk radio" is a media anachronism – night watchmen with delirium tremens and paranoid truck drivers arguing with disgraced football pundits and Yewtree-absolved former DJs about everything from Simon Mignolet's form this season to the Gaza Strip – and you'd be exactly right. But for those very reasons, it's also the most consistently, accidentally brilliant form of discourse in British culture.
</p><p>If you really want to know what's going on in this country, you won't find out on #BBCQT, where inner-city English teachers with half-finished novels pretend to fancy Ed Balls. You won't find it on Comment Is Free, or in the audience at a UCL talk with Yanis Varoufakis and Owen Jones. But you will find it on those bawdy slagging matches you can just about make out when you're trying to find Magic or Heart or Rinse or Absolute 80s from the back seat of a Prius.
</p><p>Among all the noise and fury of UK talk radio, one man stands taller than any other. It's not Gaunt or O'Connor, not Hawksbee or even Jacobs; it's George Galloway, the host of the self-proclaimed "Mother of All Talk Shows", now coming back to radio – specifically talkRADIO, a new station from the people behind talkSPORT – after a five-year break, in which GG was elected in Bradford West, defeated in Bradford West, announced as a London mayoral candidate and presumably soon de-announced as a London mayoral candidate.</p><p>Gorgeous George might be one of politics' most notable characters – a man who can't seem to leave his front door without threatening to sue someone or being assaulted by a Zionist; a man who once used the phrase "cock-a-hoop" at a US Senate hearing; a man who once pretended to be a cat in some strange game of quasi-sexual role-play on national television. But for me, it's his recently re-commissioned radio show where his finest work has been done.
</p><p>Between 2006 and 2010, The Mother of All Talk Shows became required listening for me. I think I first heard it drunk in the back of my dad's car, high and dry from some terrible half-night out, and found myself immediately captivated by the burning ire on show. From what I remember, Galloway was berating someone who was asking how "the Great could be put back into Great Britain", screaming him down with fire and brimstone. It was like nothing I'd ever heard on radio before – a weird mix of Tim Westwood and Billy Graham. On another show I seem to recall him stonily reading out a <em>Sun</em> report on the displays of wealth at Wayne Rooney's wedding, before shouting about how Wayne should read <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and learn a lesson or two.
</p><p>I thought I could be the only one listening. Surely this was only for me and maybe a few people who had died with their DABs on? But the switchboards were white-hot with bullshit. Every time Galloway cut someone off for offending him, somebody else would prop up, ready to dine in hell. Many were the talk-radio standard – white men working late-nights looking to vent about those they'd perceived as fucking them over – but the demographic also seemed to stretch far beyond that. There were racist housewives; waffling lefty professor types; young Muslim guys bigging up Galloway; even a self-proclaimed modern Nazi from Loughton. This was <em>American History X</em> sponsored by LDV Vans, I was hooked.
</p><blockquote><strong><em>TRENDING ON NOISEY – <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/meeting-the-uks-most-obsessive-vinyl-hoarders" target="_blank">From Broken Roofs to Broken Marriages: Meeting the UK's Most Obsessive Vinyl Hoarders</a></em></strong>
</blockquote><p>In his first stint on talkSPORT he survived a few controversies, notably trying to rally his listeners to come to a massive anti-Israel protest. In the end he committed a political hara-kiri: quitting to stand for parliament again. But in its afterlife, the show has perhaps found even more fame, with people uploading the classics to YouTube and racking up a community of obsessives in the process.  Some have even gone on to make playlists and compilations, such as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZyn81oEfrs" target="_blank">Galloway reads nutter texts compilation</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRzVaBZscBA" target="_blank">Galloway getting tore into hun callers</a>".
</p><p>I spoke to a few friends who have become similarly obsessed with the MOATS archive. One long-time listener, no-time caller described it to me as "one of the greatest unbroken runs in broadcasting history  my favourite thing is how he sees it as some high brow show for intellectual debate, but all he gets is lunatics and knuckle draggers. By the same token he despises anyone parochial – Protestants, Tories, Zionists, little Englanders, Rangers fans. That collision is probably the funniest thing about the show: armchair Hitlers from Ascot and Barnet ringing him to say the police force doesn't need more black people."
</p><p>And it's Galloway's remarkable self-seriousness that maintains the gold the whole thing was built on. He will argue with anyone – anyone "who thinks they're hard enough", as he says repeatedly. But many of those who think they're hard enough are more mad or sad or bored than hard, so Galloway's "good fight" is reduced to him basically shouting at faceless people with generic aliases who either don't care or don't make sense. It's the "Don't Feed the Trolls" mentality realised in audio-only Technicolor, a man with an enormous sense of self-importance shouting into an anonymous void of cackling, disembodied ghouls.<br><br>
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vyNyCPu1iS4" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="640px" data-original-height="480px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>My personal favourite moment in the show's history is the notorious "Jean in Twickenham", a quietly fuming and presumably quite pissed suburbanite who "doesn't want Scots, Irish or anyone here". She declares that she is 100 percent English and that "life was so nice" before they came. Galloway is, of course, not happy. "Have you heard of William the Conqueror, JEAN? Have you heard of the Picts, or the Celts, or The Anglo Saxons?" he bellows with his eloquent, educated, but totally incandescent rage, with not a second to stop and worry if this woman might not be sound of mind, or really that invested in her grim opinions. "Why don't you go and live in Gibraltar," mutters Galloway before cutting her off into the darkness.
</p><p>Another fan favourite is the cult-hero "Ken from the Highlands", a frequent caller who some Galloway heads have gone as far as to label a stalker. Ken – a born-again Christian who at one point started using cunning aliases like "Kenny from Blackpool" in order to get past the producers – and George had many a clash on the show, usually about issues of faith and war. Between them, there's a strange, possibly sectarian, definitely Highlands vs Central Belt feud going on; a very Scottish beef played out on nationwide radio. At one point Ken suggests that Galloway is anti-Christian because he declares himself a Catholic.  It is not the kind of thing you'd hear on <em>Question Time</em>; it's both much more weird and much more real than that.
</p><p>Galloway regards Ken as a superstitious fuddy-duddy, unfaltering in his love for Jesus and Bush. Ken regards Galloway as a fiend, a menace, a scoundrel, a child of some eastern devil. Yet, like with many of these situations, there's an odd romance to their relationship, like two ageing boxers who can't stop meeting each other in increasingly desperate promotions.
</p><p>With him back on radio, it's almost like Galloway couldn't live with out his bigoted nemeses, the people who wind him up, the people who keep him going. His dedication to arguing is such that even when he's taking a few years out of arguing in politics, he's still arguing about politics. For a man who doesn't drink, he's remarkably similar to the bloke at the pub who won't stop talking about ISIS. But whatever you think of his politics and his dealings, you have to respect his ceaseless pursuit of a barney, and his total refusal not to take it seriously. To him, every teardrop is a waterfall; every throwaway comment is a defamation case; every late-night talk show is a revolution. God knows where his latest show will go, but he'd promise you it won't be boring.

Cameron was right that if the Le Touquet Treaty Britain signed with France in
2002 were to be revoked, it would mean that migrants could just buy a ferry
ticket to Britain (they can't right now because as a result of the Treaty,
Britain begins at the Calais port). It's just that – as many "No" campaigners
were happy to point out – the Le Touquet Treaty has nothing to do with the EU. It's
only between Britain and France. Exactly the sort of treaty we'll need more of

<title>Why Was a Tory Councillor Plotting to &#039;Play Dirty&#039; with Feminist Activists?</title>

<description><![CDATA[We speak to Sisters Uncut, the women's rights campaigners caught up in a leaked smear campaign by a Tory politician.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/sisters-uncut-body-image-1455013566.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="960" data-original-height="640" data-model-id="143846" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="sisters-uncut-body-image-1455013566.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>Always a bit awkward when a top secret email leaks, isn't it. In the latest episode of Politicians Not Caring That Much, a message from a Conservative member of Portsmouth city council got out in which he suggested smearing a local anti-domestic violence charity and feminist group Sisters Uncut. In the email, Councillor Scott Harris set out his plans to attack Shonagh Dillion, the chief executive of Aurora New Dawn, a Portsmouth domestic violence support charity, as well as the local chapter of Sisters Uncut.
</p><p>The email says, "The elections are coming...quite frankly, it might be a good idea to play dirty this time." Bizarrely, as if he's the star of a shit low-budget political drama, he goes on to promise that he's "compiling some stuff on Shonagh Dillion, Aurora New Dawn, and Sisters Uncut".
</p><p>We wondered why a small-time politician wanted to attack a charity who are doing vital work to keep women in abuse relationships alive so we spoke to Emily* from Sister's Uncut.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>VICE: Hey Emily. What was your reaction to seeing the email?</strong><br><strong>Sisters Uncut: </strong>Our reaction was basically disgust. We know that two women a
week in England and Wales die as a result of domestic violence which is why
we're doing what we're doing to help save domestic abuse services across the
country, which includes this service in Portsmouth which is currently facing
£180,000 worth of cuts. It's pretty disgusting that his response to that is to
play politics with women's lives.
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>£180,000 seems a lot to cut in one small city...<br></strong>That money covers the Early Intervention Project in
Portsmouth which has won awards. It would completely cut the whole project
which includes more than a dozen staff members who'd lose their jobs. These are
workers who are highly specialised; it's not just something anyone can do. It
would cut the support that exists for doctors and social workers to get
specialist advice from domestic violence professionals if they needed it.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Why were you specifically targeted by this bloke?</strong><br>We were contacted by activists and workers in Portsmouth who had found out
about these proposals and were devastated. At the moment we're a London-based
group but we are growing. We worked in conjunction with them to stage direct
action at the council meeting which was discussing these cuts. We shut it down
with a banner drop saying that cutting these services kills women.
Interestingly, the result of that was that all the Conservative councillors ran from
the chamber. They couldn't face being confronted with the truth of what they're
doing. It's not just resources, this is women and children's lives.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>So that sparked the smear campaign? <br></strong>From the emails that we've seen, basically in order to win
the battle against us, he's willing to dig up dirt on us, see what he could
find. I guess that'd make us look bad and him and them look better.
	<br>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>What's your response to his email going to be?<br></strong>It's definitely made us more determined to do our work not
just in Portsmouth but everywhere there are people who are angry or cuts to
domestic violence services. We understand that the leader of Portstmouth
Council has said that she won't be disciplining him, she's drawing a line under
it and he's issued apologies to everyone involved. We certainly haven't
received an apology. Actually, the only apology we would accept would be a fully-funded specialist domestic violence services in Portsmouth.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<strong>Is that where you're focussing your energies at the moment, expanding
outside of the capital?
	<br></strong>We've got several groups that are starting up across the
country. We're looking at how we can go from a London-based activist group to a
mass movement. Ever since our first direct action we've been getting emails from women across
the country asking us about what's happening. Survivors of domestic violence,
workers in the sector and just people who can see what's happening in this
country and are angry.

<title>What It&#039;s Like to Be a Gay Refugee in Germany</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You travel 2,000 miles for a chance at a better life, only to arrive at your destination and realise that everything works almost exactly the same way it did at home: Coming out as a homosexual refugee in Germany is out of the question. Those guys are still afraid of exactly the same people they feared at home.</p><p class="p2">Online, when chatting or setting up dates, he calls himself Alex. He keeps his real name a secret because Alex is from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/tag/Syria" target="_blank">Syria</a>; he's a refugee and he's <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/tag/lgbt" target="_blank">gay</a>. Even in Germany, where he is supposedly safe, Alex doesn't have the courage to come out.
</p><p class="p2">Getting in touch with Alex wasn't easy. It took me several weeks to get his cell phone number and organise a meeting. We eventually met in Bochum in western Germany. He's a burly guy in his early thirties with brown hair and a meticulous haircut. He's wearing simple jeans and a dark jacket; he has the stature of a bouncer, yet he comes across as timid, even shy. He gives me a quick handshake. </p><p class="pullquote">The problem now is that a lot of people from my country have also made it to Germany. <em>- Alex, Syrian refugee<br></em><br></p><p>Alex fled Syria because of the war but also because his colleagues accidentally found out he's gay, which is an absolute deal breaker in his family. The problem now is that "a lot of people from my country have also made it to Germany. And they brought their views about gay people with them. They still reject us," Alex says.</p><p class="p2">Alex sits on the edge of the sofa – he speaks quietly but he is also open and thorough. Before leaving Syria, he studied economics and worked in a luxury hotel frequented by foreigners. He earned his own money and met other gay men once in a while. <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/4a16a9d92.html" target="_blank">Being gay is illegal in Syria</a>, with offenders facing <a href="http://www.refugeelegalaidinformation.org/syrian-arab-republic-lgbti-resources" target="_blank">at least three years</a> in prison.
</p><p class="p2">Alex keeps asking me to make sure that his real name won't be used in this article. His siblings also live in Germany and it's imperative that they don't find out about his orientation because his family would disown him immediately.
</p><p class="p2">Asylum seekers reach Europe by means of the Balkan route or the Mediterranean. And they some times carry with them the objectionable convictions of their home countries. According to Alex, most Arabs are conservative: "They're disgusted by gays. They say we need to rid society of these 'germs'."

As recently reported in <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/queerspiegel/fluechtlinge-in-berlin-homosexuelle-beklagen-mobbing-und-gewalt-in-heimen/12822924.html" target="_blank">Berlin</a> and in <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article147722602/Schwule-Fluechtlinge-von-Moslems-gepeinigt.html" target="_blank">Dresden</a>, gay men and women face daily discrimination even in those spaces. However when it comes to episodes of violence most of the cases go unreported, according to representatives from the various LGBT groups I spoke to. Still, Berlin is the first German state to do something in reaction to these attacks. According to <em>Berliner Morgenpost</em>, <a href="http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article206937079/Berlin-plant-Heim-fuer-homo-und-transsexuelle-Fluechtlinge.html" target="_blank">there are plans for a separate shelter that will exclusively house homosexual and transexual refugees</a>.
</p><p class="p2">At the moment, Alex is living in his own apartment in western Germany – he prefers it that way as it affords him a certain level of freedom. Most of the people he hangs out with, both Germans and refugees, don't have a clue that he's homosexual.
</p><p class="p2">He mostly socialises with other gay refugees at the Rosa Strippe counselling centre in Bochum, where there is a weekly meeting set up for that exact reason. Nicole Ulrich, a professional counselor, is always present. One of her responsibilities is to make sure everyone is aware of the mores in their new home – the fact that in Germany you can be open about your sexuality, for instance, or that you can hold your partner's hand in public. "People need to learn about the freedom Germany offers," Ulrich says.
</p><p class="p2">She also advises Alex and the others on another delicate point – their asylum applications. According to EU law, "facing persecution for being homosexual" is a reason to be granted asylum, in the same way that " being persecuted for your political beliefs" is. However, it's often much harder to see this through in practice because the central question becomes, 'how do I prove that I'm homosexual?'</p><p class="pullquote">Those who are persecuted for their sexuality are not only afraid but also often ashamed. They are likely to appear hesitant during the asylum interviews and then get entangled in contradictions, which often affects the result of their asylum request. <em>- </em><em>Claus Jetz, Cologne Gay and Lesbian Association</em></p><p>It all comes down to the individual interviews conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, which is part of each asylum seeker's process. The result of the application is largely based on whether the administrator finds each story believable.</p><p class="p2">Political refugees often carry official files that prove that they were persecuted in their country of origin – and many of them are proud of this proof. People who flee their homes because of their sexuality, on the other hand, officially fall into <a href="http://www.bamf.de/DE/Migration/AsylFluechtlinge/Fluechtlingsschutz/fluechtlingsschutz-node.html" target="_blank">a different category</a> – it's called " being part of a persecuted social group". This means that their human rights have been infringed on and that they've been discriminated against. </p><p>"Those who are persecuted for their sexuality are not only afraid but also often ashamed" says Claus Jetz from Cologne's Gay and Lesbian Association. "That means that they are likely to appear hesitant during the asylum interviews and then get entangled in contradictions. That is partly because most of them have had bad experiences with administrators, police and interpreters back home. They will hem and haw around and think up other reasons to apply for asylum. Sadly, the result is that often they don't come across as believable and are therefore threatened with deportation."
</p><p class="p2">To the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, "believable" means "a concrete and convincing submission of facts with exact details." Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs points out that human dignity must always be considered.
</p><p class="p2">Evidence such as videos and pictures was forbidden by the European Union in 2014. Before that, <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5718505/czech-erection-measuring-test-for-gays-is-unsurprisingly-controversial" target="_blank">the Czech Republic used phallometric tests to determine whether someone was gay</a>. Now even intimate questions are forbidden – at least in theory. According to Nicole Ulrich, these are still quite common: "The methods of questioning are in fact rather questionable. To my knowledge, applicants have been asked to explain how their sexuality works under repugnant conditions." For that reason, LGBT organisations are demanding better education for both the interviewers as well as the interpreters.
</p><p>The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees does not register how many people apply for asylum citing their sexuality as the reason they faced persecution back home. But they do observe countries of origin. In Iran for example, the situation is clear – <a href="http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/02/03/global-homophobia-index-over-80-countries-say-disguise-or-die" target="_blank">homosexuals face a death sentence</a>. But the situation gets more complicated with other countries. For instance, the criteria on which the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs judges a country as safe or unsafe are unclear. They consider both Ghana and Senegal to be <a href="http://www.bamf.de/DE/Migration/AsylFluechtlinge/Asylverfahren/BesondereVerfahren/SichereHerkunftsl%C3%A4nder/sichere-herkunftsl%C3%A4nder-node.html" target="_blank">"Safe Countries of Origin"</a>, even though <a href="http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=12395&ArticleId=2404845" target="_blank">homosexuality is illegal</a> in <a href="http://76crimes.com/tag/ghana/" target="_blank">both</a>. I did reach out to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a comment but did not get a response.</p><p class="p2">Alex from Syria has just had his asylum application interview, during which he says he didn't tell the whole truth either. He talked about the Syrian civil war and only made vague references to being part of a "persecuted social group". He said no word about him being gay – which means that he could be sent back as soon as the civil war ends.</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.vice.com/de" target="_blank">VICE Germany</a></em><br></p>

high red-brick walls that surround the entrance of HM Holloway Prison, the
largest women's jail in western Europe, are adorned with hanging baskets of
flowers. It's a futile attempt by the authorities to beautify the institution.
Holloway has a "<a href="http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/prisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/03/holloway-2013.pdf" target="_blank">fearsome reputation</a>": half of its population are victims of domestic
violence, 95 percent are on some form of psychotropic medicine.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">It
was behind these walls that Sarah Reed – a black woman with mental health
problems who was placed in the prison on custodial remand – died having apparently <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/sarah-reed-death-in-custody" target="_blank">strangled herself</a> to death on 11th January 2016; and it was in
front of them that one hundred people descended last night to hold a candle-lit
vigil and to demand clarity about what happened. 
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Organised
at short notice by campaign group Blacksox on the request of Reed's family, the vigil lasted
an hour-and-a-half as speakers – some representing organisations, others
independent – spoke through a megaphone to a mournful and resolute crowd. 
	
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/sarah-reed-vigil-photos-bethell-koshy-body-image-1455015293-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="800" data-model-id="143875" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="sarah-reed-vigil-photos-bethell-koshy-body-image-1455015293.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p>Lee Jasper, the anti-racist activist and spokesperson for Reed's family, announced the
formation of the Justice For Sarah Reed campaign; black women with experience
of the prison system and mental health institutions attested to Sarah's
struggle; Stephanie Lightfoot-Bennett of United Friends and Family Campaign
declared the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Crown Prosecution
Service to be "unfit for purpose"; a poet gave a lyrical history of anti-black
racism in Britain; Sisters Uncut heckled George Galloway and stopped him from
speaking (he promptly left); and a young woman told the crowd she had
come for "all the black, single vulnerable women who find themselves neglected
over and over again."
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal"> 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">For
all its tragic details, 
	<a href="http://leejasper.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/sarah-reid-black-woman-victim-of.html">the
events of Sarah Reed's life</a> are exemplary: they show how state
violence operates on the vulnerable – destabilising minds, erasing lives and
conspiring silence. One purpose of the vigil was to undo this silence. Cars and
buses passing by honked their horns in support; the short speeches ended
with a call-and-response between the speaker and crowd, each time becoming
louder and louder:  "Say her name: Sarah
Reed! Say her name: Sarah Reed! Black. Lives. Matter!"</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CBethell_photo" target="_blank">@CBethell_photo</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/Yohannk" target="_blank">@Yohannk</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/im-the-best-writer-in-the-world-an-interview-with-crime-author-jo-nesbo-body-image-1455013848-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1200" data-original-height="798" data-model-id="143850" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="im-the-best-writer-in-the-world-an-interview-with-crime-author-jo-nesbo-body-image-1455013848.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p>Jo Nesbø is better than you at most things. In his time he has been: a top-flight footballer in the Norwegian Tippeligaen with Molde; a high-flying stockbroker; and a Norwegian pop star. But all that pales in comparison to what he's best known for: writing those books your dad can't stop buying in the airport. Well, your dad and everyone else's. Nesbo's Harry Hole crime series, among others, has shifted 28million units in over 50 countries. According to his publisher, one of his books is bought every 23 seconds.
</p><p>An adaptation of one of his novels – <em>Headhunters</em> – won a Bafta. Leonardo DiCaprio's production company recently bought the rights to another one, <em>Blood on Snow</em>. And now a film version of <em>The Snowman</em>, starring Michael Fassbender, has just started filming. So we caught up with Jo to talk about his life and career, from punk rock to crime writing.</p><p><strong>VICE: Hi Jo. You once described crime novels as the "punk rock of literature". What did you mean by that? </strong><br><strong>Jo Nesbø: </strong>To me, punk rock is about taking away everything that is not necessary so you can see the skeleton of the song. I think that crime writing, at least the crime writing that I like, is the same thing. The story is cut to the bone. The one thing that my books don't do that punk rock does is statements. My books are the opposite; they are questions. I give my protagonists moral dilemmas and force them to make a choice. And I try not to be the judge of the choice they make. One of the big questions I try to ask is, what is free will? What is morality? Is it something God-given, or is it a framework that society has imposed on us to make us more efficient?</p><p class="pullquote">I never liked crime fiction as a kid. Well, I'm still not that interested in crime fiction.<br>
</p><p><strong>Your parents fought on different sides during the second world war, didn't they? Do you think that's where your obsession with morality came from? </strong><br>Yes. My mother's family were freedom fighters against the Nazi occupation of Norway. But my father, who was older, grew up in America in the 20s where he was conditioned to believe the worst thing that could happen to a country was communism. So when the war broke out he joined the Germans to fight Stalin. Although, it wasn't until I was 15 that he said, "Jo, you're old enough to know now that I fought with the Germans in the second world war."</p><p><strong>How does a 15-year-old even process that kind of information?<br></strong>It was a huge shock. My father was the man I respected most in the world. Everything I thought was solid and true in the world was shattered in a moment. But then he said, "Ok, I guess you have questions, then I'm happy to answer them." So I started this conversation with my father when I was 15 and it continued until the end of his life.</p><p><strong>Did you ever understand? Your mother's family must have hated him.<br></strong>They would've hated him if he'd been pro-Hitler and joined the Nazi party. But they understood that he did it to defend Norway from Stalin; that was his war. He didn't know about the Holocaust. Yes, he'd heard rumours, but thought that's all they were. I remember once he told me, "I had to spend three years in jail for fighting with the Germans, and I think that was a fair punishment for being as wrong as I was." I respected him for his honesty. I can defend my father intellectually now – the wounds heal, but that shock creates an emotional scar that never goes away.
</p><p><strong>Your band Di Derre ("Those Guys") are one of Norway's most successful groups. But you worked as a stockbroker until your 30s. How did that happen?</strong><br>I only quit the city when the band became too big to hold down another job. I had this crazy idea that I didn't want to leave my day job – I didn't want music to pay my rent. I thought, if I had a day job, I wouldn't have to compromise. I've seen too many musicians sell out in order to survive.
</p><p><strong>How would you describe Di Derre's music?<br></strong>We're a pop band with a punk attitude.</p><p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZEBaE1ta32E" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="560px" data-original-height="315px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br><strong>Was crime fiction always part of your life? <br></strong>Not at all. I never really liked crime fiction as a kid. Well, I'm still not that interested in crime fiction.


</p><p><strong>A crime writer who doesn't like crime writing? <br></strong>Whenever I meet crime writers, they are so into crime writing. All they want to talk about is these crime writers that I've never read and I'm never going to read. I'm a slow reader so I have to pick my books carefully. I have a few favourites, like Jim Thompson and Raymond Chandler, but even when I read Chandler for the first time I had already read all the parodies. By then he seemed almost comic and over the top.
</p><p><strong>So you don't think modern crime fiction is that good?<br></strong>No. There are definitely good crime novels out there, but I think there's a reason why the crime genre has the bad reputation that it has, and that is the fact that so many mediocre crime novels are being published every year.
</p><p><strong>What about yours?<br></strong>When I'm writing, I feel like I'm the best writer in the world. I don't mean that in a competitive way, but that I have to think, "There's nobody who understands this story better than me and the readers are lucky that I'm the one telling this story and not some other clumsy writer." The whole idea of writing a novel takes an enormous amount of confidence. Books are expensive in Norway, but you expect thousands of readers to read every fucking work you've written. And then you expect them to walk up to you in the street and take you by hand and say, "thank you."
</p><p><strong>Do they?</strong><br>Sometimes they do. When I'm writing a novel I get the feeling that this is what I am meant to do. Not that I feel necessarily unique... But even if the whole world told me I was not good at telling stories, then I would say that the world is not ready for me. That is the only thing in life that I'm 100 percent confident in. It's not a crazy ego thing, it is just that I have a very clear idea of what I want to do as a storyteller.
</p><p><strong>So what did you actually want to do with your life – you played for Molde FK when you were a teenager. Was football the original dream?</strong><br>I genuinely believed I'd play professionally for Tottenham. It was my life, until I got injured. I got tackled as I was passing and my knee buckled. I heard the cartilage snap, like when you tear the leg off a chicken, and that was my footballing career over. I was 19. It was devastating - my entire world fell apart. But you know what, when you're 19, you can build a new world in three weeks. I told myself, "OK, I'm probably not going to play soccer. How important is that to me? Is this a trauma that has to define my life?"
</p><p><strong>If you could trade in all the success you've had as a writer and a pop star to be a footballer, would you do it?</strong><br>I've never been asked that before... It's a hard thing to say. Would I really? . Yes, I think I would.
</p><p><strong>Thanks Jo. </strong>

<title>We Recreated the Oscars Goodie Bag For the Low, Low Price of £10</title>

<description><![CDATA[This year the Oscar nominees are getting a goodie bag worth $200,000, but here's how to do it at home.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/we-got-the-oscars-goodie-bag-for-11-745-body-image-1454948778.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="650" data-original-height="433" data-model-id="143609" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="we-got-the-oscars-goodie-bag-for-11-745-body-image-1454948778.jpg" class="vmp-image">All this could be yours for a mere £11
</p><p>Free gifts are always better appreciated by people who can already afford them: that is just the cold truth. You there, with your mug full of change, waiting by the big machine at Morrisons hoping to get voucher enough to buy three tins of beans: a $31,000 skin cream voucher would be wasted on you. You, you there, with the Wonga.com app already loaded on your phone, ready for its just-like-clockwork boot-up on the 20th of every month: free Audi rentals for life are not going to help you. It makes sense that the great and the beautiful good get rewarded beyond supermodels to have sex with and multi-million dollar salaries at the Oscars this year. It makes sense that the goodie bag for each nominee includes a ludicrous $200,000 (£138,000) worth of free shit.
</p><p>The Oscar's press team described the contents of the goodie bag as being,  "once again a blend of fabulous, fun and functional items meant to thrill and pamper those who may have everything money can buy but still savor the simple joy of a gift". Hey, guys, be nice: incredibly wealthy people enjoy free shit too.
</p><blockquote><strong><em>On NOISEY: </em></strong><a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/how-leeds-diy-scene-recovered-from-the-floods" target="_blank"><strong><em>How the UK Floods Proved the Importance of DIY Scenes to Local Music Communities</em></strong></a>
</blockquote><p>The bag is filled with a mixture of things, from the completely bizarre cosmetic procedures (a voucher for the 'Vampire Breast Lift' promises "blood-derived growth factors to revive rounder cleavage without implants") through to more predictable items, such as a 10-day first class trip to Israel, or a $250 dildo. Also: a $249.99 vape, because vaping is cool.
</p><p>Unfortunately, for reasons, we weren't invited to the Oscars this year. But we wanted to get involved in the goodie bag-shaped fun anyway. So here's how we put our own together, on a slightly pared down budget of £10.98.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/we-got-the-oscars-goodie-bag-for-11-745-body-image-1454948943.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="650" data-original-height="433" data-model-id="143610" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="we-got-the-oscars-goodie-bag-for-11-745-body-image-1454948943.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p><strong>Oscar winners get: a 10-day first class trip to Israel (£38,000)<br></strong><strong>We got: a framed oil painting of Larry David (£4)</strong>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Why go all the way to the Holy Land? As any <i>Curb</i> enthusiast knows, Larry David's
relationship with Israel is profound, which is why we put him in a frame
instead of buying £38,000 plane tickets and hotels and flights and a guide and
a book called 'What Israel Is?'. Most notably Larry David's love for Israel
(and world peace) was brought out in the 
	<i>Curb</i>
	episode 'Palestinian Chicken', where Larry attempts to solve the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict by wooing a lady at a Palestinian-American
restaurant. Needless to say many viewers found the episode distasteful. But
there's nothing distasteful about this £4 Matalan picture frame!

</p><p><strong>Oscar winners get: Ultherapy – a laser skin-tightening procedure courtesy of 740 Park MD (£3,800)<br></strong><strong>We got: 50 wooden pegs (99p)</strong>
</p><p>Yes lasers are scientifically more likely to have a lasting tightening effect on the skin when properly shot at you by a trained professional, but they are also expensive (bad) and can possibly be retooled by a Bond villain to be some earth-destroyed hyper weapon (v bad). Instead, peg your saggy face back onto your skull with these actual pegs: hygienic, affordable, and a 50-pack should last you weeks.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/we-got-the-oscars-goodie-bag-for-11-745-body-image-1454948999.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="650" data-original-height="487" data-model-id="143612" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="we-got-the-oscars-goodie-bag-for-11-745-body-image-1454948999.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p><strong>Oscar winners get: a lifetime supply of Lizora skin creams (~£21,000)<br></strong><strong>We got: 1 x pot of Hollywood Beauty Cocoa Butter (£3.49)</strong>
</p><p>I mean depending on how often you use it: this pot could feasibly last a lifetime. It is extremely petroleum-heavy and rich. A little goes a long way. Unless you have exceptionally warm fingers, it is quite hard to get out of the pot. And, fundamentally, aren't all creams basically the same? A wholesale scam by the beauty industry to make us invest in unguents? If anything, the Hollywood Beauty Cocoa Butter (which says the word 'Hollywood' <em>multiple times</em> on the pot, guys) is too expensive for what you get.

<title>Science Finally Explained My Resting Bitch Face to Me</title>

<description><![CDATA[After researchers used a program called FaceReader to study the phenomenon of "Resting Bitch Face," I decided to get my hands on the program myself and see how bad my RBF was.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/finally-my-resting-bitch-face-explained-body-image-1454988283.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="600" data-original-height="400" data-model-id="143731" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="finally-my-resting-bitch-face-explained-body-image-1454988283.jpg" class="vmp-image">The author, when asked to smile for a photo</p><p>I was a pretty serious kid. Teachers used to call me a "thinker," which was fine until around the time I turned 19. That was when what I considered to be my neutral expression got a new name: Resting Bitch Face (RBF).</p><p>If you haven't heard of RBF before, here's a quick explainer from the internet's best friend UrbanDictionary: "A condition that affects 1 in 6 people meaning that their 'zoned out face' is in a constant state of bitchiness e.g. 'Claire Horn has resting bitch face!!'"</p><p>Yes, Claire Horn does have Resting Bitch Face, and so do I. If you want to get into specifics, my particular form of RBF has been described as "perpetually unimpressed" or "about to sneeze."</p><p>I'm not going to lie. It's been a rough couple of years. At least I haven't been alone, though. Victoria Beckham, Kristen Stewart, Kanye—we've all lived through this together. VB and KStew exhibit the most common type of RBF: "lemon mouth angry school principal." Kanye, one of the few widely cited male RBFers, is afflicted by a rarer form dubbed, "Son, I expected more of you."</p><p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/finally-my-resting-bitch-face-explained-body-image-1454983057.png?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="600" data-original-height="353" data-model-id="143716" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="finally-my-resting-bitch-face-explained-body-image-1454983057.png" class="vmp-image">Kristen Stewart's face. Image <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu-WZBcKwg" target="_blank">via</a> YouTube</p><p>RBF is frustrating to live with but finally science has brought some answers. Last year, two behavioral researchers, Jason Rogers and Abbe Macbeth, used a technology <a href="http://info.noldus.com/throwing-shade-the-science-of-rbf" target="_blank">called FaceReader</a> to determine whether RBF is actually a thing, or just a delusion in the eye of the beholder. FaceReader scans more than 500 points on the human face and assigns an expression based on eight "basic" emotions: happy, angry, sad, scared, surprised, disgusted, contemptuous, or neutral.</p><p class="">To create a baseline, Rogers and Macbeth ran "normal" faces through FaceReader and found that most people's resting faces register as "neutral." Then they ran photos and videos of celebrities most often accused of RBF—Kanye, KStew, etc. What the pair found is that these faces registered far higher "contempt" than the normies. That sneering, condescending emotion accounts for around 5.76 percent of the resting expression for those afflicted with RBF.</p><p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fctR0kqgzkPA14a_3bfdxRHwKvnc8IOaL3mQtK9NdhSIGZhx7pFBxBDCWxi8Y14Zl6yaOSH4oR_cs0gfztDyMiGH7zXr5w8xUnoBRkNADuoSbKOB64fR-qFgF-aVpmuITK0n6725" width="602" height="213">Kanye West's face being analyzed. Image via Noldus</p><p>This doesn't sound great but there's still hope. "This is a fundamental and key point," Rogers and Macbeth note in a paper about their work. "FaceReader is not detecting enough contempt to reflect true contempt... It just looks like contempt to the viewer." As they explain, the human brain is hardwired to comb other people's faces for emotional cues and so even tiny differences can make an impression. "Because contempt is based upon elements of comparison and judgment, viewing this in someone's face creates a feeling of uneasiness, or uncomfortableness, for the person viewing that face," they explain.</p><p>So there it is—science says Resting Bitch Face is your problem, not mine. However, having the self esteem of someone who's been teased most of her adult life about her RBF, my main takeaway from this research is that looking at my face makes people uneasy and uncomfortable.</p><p>This research did give us a number though: 5.67 percent. This is the line where RBF begins. If the percentage of contempt in your expression falls below this threshold, you're in the clear. What if I'd been unfairly grouped in with those discomfort-inducing sneerers for all these years? All I needed was a contempt score below 5.67 percent. To find out, I got myself a copy of FaceReader to run some experiments.</p><p class="">By run some experiments, I mean that I wasted the next few hours of my life trying to take a selfie that was totally blank—it's impossible. We've been conditioned to pull some sort of expression whenever a camera is pointed in our faces. In some photos my eyes were too narrow; in others what I thought was a subtle smile came out as a full-blown sneer. It seems I have absolutely no control over my face.</p><p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/09/finally-my-resting-bitch-face-explained-body-image-1454983270.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="597" data-original-height="400" data-model-id="143718" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="finally-my-resting-bitch-face-explained-body-image-1454983270.jpg" class="vmp-image">My face being analyzed by FaceReader</p><p>I finally gave up on attaining expressionless perfection and just put a photo into FaceReader. It did some <em>Minority Report</em> biometric shit and spat out some graphs with all the answers I was looking for.</p><span id="docs-internal-guid-a0bf7bfe-c3b9-c93a-b7a1-587c77ae3177"><p dir="ltr" class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gwO9KFjblm_j_Iw45gJRb6e18oYEv3dtJEXe5I-9Suc11Qq6x9o8uM4yXLbmtZ2Ac24nlVxMsGQRzo6Ufw6OC2fVIAGILrhJV-0nkx50EfVtuodr4OXpv7QPCO02rxmSooMxU2-b" width="600" height="208" alt="graphs.jpg"></p><p dir="ltr">So the good news is the computer knows I'm lady, and it doesn't think I have a beard or a mustache. The gray bar in the chart is neutral, which is the clearly the dominant emotion in my expression. There's also some happiness in there, maybe some faint hope that FaceReader could give me the all clear from RBF.</p><p>But then there was the bad news: My contempt is pretty much off the charts. It's way above the RBF threshold. I'm even worse than Kanye. Kanye freaking West, the guy so famously grouchy there are <a href="http://www.rantlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/filepicker-0wLTZLjaQo24AjyEp3zb_kanye_funny_face1.jpg" target="_blank">memes about it</a>. Kanye West, who didn't even crack a smile when Amy Schumer threw herself at his feet on the red carpet.</p><p>So I guess science has confirmed that I have RBF. I'm not really sure how to feel about it, but I probably look pretty angry.</p><p><em>Follow Maddison on <a href="https://twitter.com/madconnaughton" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p></span>

</p><p class="photo-credit"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">A right pair of useless wankers TBH. (via <a href="http://www.public-domain-image.com/free-images/fauna-animals/birds/eagle-birds-images/bald-eagle-pictures/a-pair-of-bald-eagles-perched-on-a-branch.jpg" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>)</span>
</p><p>When I first heard that eagles were being trained to attack drones, my initial reaction was, 'Well, I sure like the sound of that.' It means us luddites can use them to fight back in the inevitable battle between man and machine, between technology and good old elbow grease. It means the movie that will be made about our meaty struggle against the borg oppressors will be even better, cuz it'll feature wing-ed beasts scratching away at the inner wiring of an airborne termination unit, a dog fight between nature and creation. Wow!
</p><p>Or, as I found out from Jonny Ames, head honcho over at birds-of-prey sanctuary and conservation area <a href="http://www.eagleheights.co.uk/" target="_blank">Eagle Heights</a> in Kent, it won't be like that at all. In fact it'll probably be the opposite. The eagles will get absolutely fucked by the drones. But why? Mr. Ames and I chatted about the drone attacks, eagles in general, and why, when it comes down to it, birds of prey are just a bunch of selfish pricks, really.
</p><p><strong>VICE: Hi Jonny. Can you tell us w</strong><strong>hat you do at Eagle Heights?<br></strong>We started about 20 years ago as a small bird of prey centre. We built ourselves up to be a bird of prey and wildlife sanctuary as well. At Eagle Heights, our main purpose is education. We do big displays where we fly a bird freely outside. We also go to a lot of schools with birds of prey, country shows, and the odd bit of film work. We have a breeding project and we do rescue and rehabilitation of wild birds of prey.</p><p><strong>Basically everything you can think of to do with birds of prey, then.<br></strong>I would say so. We even have a bald eagle that flies at Crystal Palace Football Club as their mascot. Her name's Kayla, and she flies at all the home games. We drive her up for each game with two to three members of staff.</p><p><strong>Wow. How do you tame an eagle to the point where it's happy to fly around a stadium filled with thousands of people?<br></strong>There are two ways of doing it. One's called hand-rearing, which is when you have an eagle from a chick, and it only knows humans and doesn't know its parents. It grows up thinking it's a human, and will bond with you quite well. Hand-reared eagles can also be quite aggressive, because they have no fear of anything whatsoever. It's all basically down to food. It isn't loyalty like a dog. With birds of prey it's down to trust and food.</p><p>If an eagle is parent-raised, when it first comes out of the aviary it'll be quite scared. We have a big dark area for them, because when they're in the dark they're quite calm. We go in and slowly but surely let them get used to us. Once they fully trust you they'll fly free and then come back to you for their dinner, basically. </p><p><strong>I've been there. In comparison to other intelligent animals such as an octopus, where do eagles rank?<br></strong>They're nothing like an octopus or a dolphin; they're nowhere near as intelligent. They're not a stupid animal, but again they're not as smart as a parrot, because in the old days, people could train parrots to ride bikes and all sorts of stuff. You wouldn't get an eagle to do that. Because they're a top predator, they're quite fixed into flying and food and not a lot else comes into it. </p><p class="pullquote">In the old days, people could train parrots to ride bikes and all sorts of stuff. You wouldn't get an eagle to do that.<br></p><p><strong><br>What do you think the eagle's primary usefulness to humanity is?</strong> <br>There are a few different ones. In places like Mongolia and Kazakhstan, there's been a long history of golden eagles being used by farmers to kill wolves. And in the olden days people used to use birds of prey to catch food. That's probably our main thing with eagles.</p><p><strong>Sounds like a lot of smashing things up and goring stuff, which also seems to be the aim with the drones.<br></strong>It's all food association with the drones. What they're doing is teaching a bald eagle that when it catches that drone, it gets fed. That's how they train them.</p><p><strong>How do you feel about using eagles to catch drones? Is it fair?<br></strong>I think it's a publicity stunt, to be honest. Eagles aren't very manoeuvrable. If somebody knew what they were doing with a drone, they could outfly an eagle. Welfare-wise, bald eagles, which is what they're using, are very, very tough. There wouldn't really be any injuries, apart from obviously if the propeller hit the eagle in the eye. That would be the main risk.</p><p><strong>I get the feeling that the eagles talons could quite easily crush the drone.<br></strong>Yeah. The power in an eagle's talons is unbelievable. They would destroy the drone.</p><p><strong>What is it about eagles that people like so much, do you think?<br></strong>I think it's purely because of their sheer size and power. They're the biggest flying killing machines, if you like. In New Zealand, there used to be an eagle called Harpagornis Moorei (Haast's Eagle, now extinct) that would kill humans, because humans would dress up in the feathers of its prey, which the eagle would mistake them for. This eagle was enormous. I think it is all to do with that primal, hunting, pride and power aspect.</p><p><strong>Have you ever had any incidents involving the eagles?<br></strong>They can be quite aggressive towards the staff. We've never had a problem with the public because they don't associate the public with food, but quite a few of our hand-reared bald eagles, if they don't think you're feeding them quick enough, they will beat you up to try and get food out of you. People new to flying an eagle will panic and throw the food away from them. The eagle then learns that if it beats you up, you're going to throw food. It's a novice mistake.</p><p><strong>So the best thing to do is to just chill out.<br></strong>Yeah. I mean I've been grabbed by them and bitten by them and all sorts of stuff. When you're training eagles it is part of the job. You've got to accept the fact that you're working with a wild animal and now and again they're going to catch you out.</p><p><strong>What's the worst injury you've sustained from one of these eagles?<br></strong>I had my bottom lip split open by a bald eagle. I've also been grabbed in the back of the head with an eagle's talons because I stupidly turned my back to an eagle that didn't like me. Normally it's my mistake. Like I say, there's no danger to the public with eagles. Unless someone was to run up and grab one without a glove on.</p><p><strong>Well, that would be fucking stupid, wouldn't it?<br></strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>Lastly, do you think it's OK to use animals for reasons that may also have political connotations, such as the taking down of drones, or even using sniffer dogs?<br></strong>Yeah I do. I train animals and also have a lot to do with conservation, and I don't see anything wrong with it as long as the person who's in charge knows what they're doing. You get people who ignore the rules and the dangers and they're the sort of people who cause risks.</p><p><strong>Thanks Jonny.</strong>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Campo Santo's eagerly anticipated debut game, <em>Firewatch</em>, is out now. Set in the 1980s, it casts the player as Henry, a 40-something guy from Colorado looking to temporarily escape his past – which we're not about to reveal – by spending a summer watching for fires in Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming.
</p><p>What begins as a relaxing, some might say boring, way to see out a few months soon turns sinister, as Henry – as well as his supervisor Delilah, stationed in a nearby (but unreachable) watchtower of her own – finds himself threatened by a force that's got little to do with the natural beauty around him. He's not alone out here – a mysterious person is roaming the area, whose intentions are far from crystal. He doesn't want Henry and Delilah contacting the authorities about his movements. Something is decidedly not right about all of this.
</p><p>VICE Gaming editor Mike Diver and freelancer Emma Quinlan played through the game, separately, before having a conversation about its strengths and (very limited) weaknesses. The short version: you should play this game. The long version, the back-and-forth between two impressed gamers, follows below.

</p><p><strong>Mike Diver:</strong> Emma, you've finished <em>Firewatch</em>. Me too. If you could summarise your experience in just a few lines, which we can then bounce off to further the discussion, what would they be? No spoilers, obviously.
</p><p><strong>Emma Quinlan: </strong>My experience with <em>Firewatch</em> was a surprising one, in a very positive way. What transpired in the game's plot, I definitely didn't see coming. But it was how quickly I became emotionally invested in <em>Firewatch</em>'s characters that surprised me the most. The opening of the game actually made me cry, and yes, you can call me a big lady part for that, if you want.
</p><p><strong>MD:</strong> I'll refrain from calling you anything at all, because I certainly felt the same way during the game's opening moments. Again, I'm deadly keen to avoid spoilers, but I think we need to mention something about the first minutes of <em>Firewatch</em>. The "choose your own adventure" section, where you're effectively laying down the foundations for who your character, Henry (definitely not Hank) is, took me by surprise and gave me true reason to pause. I didn't rush through it, as I often do through "standard" character-creation tools. I regularly select default options. But here, I felt really connected to Henry, without ever seeing his face – and that's completely because of how Campo Santo open proceedings. Without imagery, just with words. In many respects, that's a fine precedent for what follows, as while the game is beautiful to look at (for the most part – I'll get onto my issues with it soon enough), its real strength is its story.
</p><p>Would you agree with that? Having finished it a few nights ago, I keep thinking what a great little novel its story would make. I'd read it. Is that the aspect of the game that's lasting longest for you, do you think?
</p><p><strong><em>Article continues after the video below</em></strong>
</p><h3>Watch VICE's film <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/video/agafias-taiga-life-part-1" target="_blank">'Agafia's Taiga Life'</a>, about life in the remotest part of Siberia </h3><iframe src="//embeds.vice.com/?playerId=YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5&aid=vice.com/far-out&vid=loN29tYTozx9zUCWvSAfmbcr4dAHlTDP&embedCode=loN29tYTozx9zUCWvSAfmbcr4dAHlTDP&cust_params=embdom%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_uk%2Fvideo%2Fagafias-taiga-life-part-1%26topic%3Dtravel%26aid%3Dagafias-taiga-life-part-1%26auth%3DVICE+Staff%26keywords%3DFar+out%2Ctravel%2CRussia%2Ctaiga%2CCold%2Chermits%2CAgafia%5C%27s+Taiga+Life%26ac%3Dno%26country%3Den_uk%26contentId%3DloN29tYTozx9zUCWvSAfmbcr4dAHlTDP&ad_rule=1&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen_uk%2Fvideo%2Fagafias-taiga-life-part-1&autoplay=0&share_url=http://www.vice.com/en_uk/video/agafias-taiga-life-part-1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe><p><strong>EQ:</strong> Yes, certainly. Like you, I often put as little effort into characters creation as I can in order to get to the main game. With <em>Firewatch</em>, I couldn't do that. I had to really think these decisions through, as I didn't want to mess anything up for Henry. The decisions are very realistic, so much so that I've experienced one of them myself in real life, and I think that's what draws you in about the game: you can imagine yourself in Henry's shoes. So quickly that you aren't just a passive viewer of the story anymore, you're actively involved, which like you said, sets the precedent for how you play the game later on and how you feel about the situations that arise.
</p><p>I've not been able to stop thinking about the story – it was very gripping, and certainly <em>Firewatch</em>'s biggest strength. Did you also go on an emotional roller coaster with it?
</p><p><strong>MD:</strong> I don't know about roller coaster exactly, but I certainly felt my shoulders tensing, my heart rate rising, during the game's final third. Without giving too much away, I think it masterfully measures how to layer suspense. It gives you a whole set of problems, going on around Henry – and by extension the never-seen but always-heard supporting character Delilah, watching over things from another tower – and that led to me feeling like I was going up the incline towards a massive drop. And when the peak was reached, the game really felt like it could go anywhere.
</p><p>There was a sniff of governmental conspiracy about proceedings. I know that game previews have shown that you're not alone in the wilderness, and knowing that someone else is out here with you, maybe hunting you, kept me forever sweeping the camera around, checking out crannies and stirring bushes, just in case. Naturally it's a very scripted game so I knew that whatever bad shit was going to happen absolutely would, regardless of my caution – and when that something actually did, I jumped off the sofa. But it really is a wonderfully controlled story, that puts all these different plot line pieces on place for, I guess, 60 percent of the game, letting your mind play with them, over and over, before delivering the linearity that takes you to the climax.
</p><p>For a game that really doesn't feature any human contact, I not only found myself attached to Henry, because of how Campo Santo set him up, but also Delilah. Even stationed at a distant watchtower, she's a more three-dimensional character than many we see in gaming. A lot of that comes down to the performance of Cissy Jones, her voice actor, of course, but nevertheless I was really impressed by the relationship that builds between Henry, "you", and her. She's really the star of this game, I think. But what do you think?
</p><div class="resp-video-wrapper youtube-wrapper"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2LgqUiqTvio" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-original-width="560px" data-original-height="315px" webkitallowfullscreen webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="photo-credit">'Firewatch', the June Fire trailer
</p><p><strong>EQ: </strong>The final third was where I also became most tense, but I found myself a few times during others parts of the game feeling uneasy, although not quite to the same extent. I think the most impressive way they created suspense was through Delilah, who I agree was the best character in the game. Through her, you gain information that Henry himself wouldn't be able to know, and so she was the source of many revelations, ones that made me stop in my tracks a few times.
</p><p>Like you said, the story is very well controlled, giving you enough time to ponder possibilities, but not enough that you feel bored or underwhelmed by the action. Campo Santo really nailed the whole idea of isolation, of being alone with your thoughts, guessing what would happen next – and that was exactly what I did throughout. Again, I agree that it felt like it could anywhere, a government conspiracy certainly seeming on the cards. A lot of the time, I felt like something was going to happen, then when it did, like you I was still surprised, swearing being my main form of expression at one point. I too kept an eye out on a constant basis, my camera doing constant 360s and zooms, although I did just haul ass at one point.
</p><p>The voice performance overall I thought was incredible, but like I've said, I agree Delilah was the star. You really feel a connection with her, not just situational, but mentally as well. She was also a great comfort to me while I was hiking through the wilderness; it was nice to know someone was there, someone who genuinely seemed to care. I would have liked to speak to her more if anything, she was very amusing at times.
</p><p><strong>MD: </strong>Yeah, I think it would have been nice to start more off-the-cuff conversations with her – I was constantly squeezing the left trigger to see if I could initiate communication with her, just while exploring, rather than waiting for her scripted interjections. But I also appreciate that this is a game made by a small team with limited resources, and respect that what they've achieved is still impressive.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/05/wood-you-kindly-a-critical-conversation-about-firewatch-750-body-image-1454694975-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1920" data-original-height="1080" data-model-id="142944" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/05/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/05/" data-image-filename="wood-you-kindly-a-critical-conversation-about-firewatch-750-body-image-1454694975.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p><strong>EQ:</strong> I also think Delilah was so easy to become attached to was because she seemed human. She had problems, she got drunk, she was sarcastic – it felt like a real woman was at the other end of that line. In the end it felt like you had someone with you, regardless of the fact they weren't there "in body", and I found that to be a very impressive aspect of the game.
</p><p>I think the consistency of the interactions made it feel even more real, too, each character remembering things you'd said in past conversations, topics never just being forgotten. I think that's probably another testament to how good the story is: everything is so intrinsically woven together that no conversation felt meaningless, or just inserted to fill up space.
</p><p>It would have been nice to initiate random conversations, maybe seek comfort when I might have needed it; but then again being given that option, it could have taken away from the truly tender moments, and so maybe it's best we weren't given that choice.
</p><p><strong>MD: </strong>Yes, the "real" factor really does come across in how the two leads interact – which is useful as they're almost the only voices you hear in the whole game.
</p><p>I was thinking, which can be dangerous, but bear with me. The last game that really gave me a sense of someone on the "other end of the line" being a believable character was <em>BioShock</em>. And that's a game set in a place of beauty that's gone to shit – a little like <em>Firewatch</em>. I've just looked on Wikipedia and it states that <em>BioShock</em> was an influencing factor in this game's walkie-talkie mechanic. But I dare say that <em>Firewatch</em> does it better, even, than that first <em>BioShock</em>. Perhaps it's because of my thoughts of <em>BioShock</em> that I kept on expecting a massive twist in the plot. No spoilers! But yeah, it's not like it plays that way, even though <em>Firewatch</em> is still, I think, a shocking game.
</p><p><strong>EQ: </strong>I can certainly see the influence, but I would say <em>Firewatch</em> mastered it. I think the true isolation aspect of the game is why it works better. In <em>BioShock</em> you're always encountering enemies, the action really taking precedent over anything else. In <em>Firewatch</em> you're completely alone, so it makes that relationship even more poignant. As for the story, I don't think it's quite as shocking as <em>BioShock</em>, but I do think I was more concerned about the main characters in <em>Firewatch</em>, as well as intrigued to see what happened to them next.
</p><blockquote><strong>On Motherboard: </strong><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/you-can-now-3d-print-a-copy-of-the-moon" target="_blank"><strong>You Can Now 3D Print a Copy of the Moon</strong></a></blockquote><p><strong>MD: </strong>To pause for a moment to look at a negative, the frame rate on PlayStation 4 is a <em>disaster</em>. I constantly saw middle-distance assets pop up, and while climbing up rocks the game would jerk from a position of mid-ascent to the top. This wasn't a factor in the closed-in spaces – in the cave, in Henry's tower. But I dare say that the game's open world suffers slightly because of its performance. Which is a real shame, as it's such a lovely place to stroll about in. Did you see anything like that?
</p><p><strong>EQ: </strong>I played on PS4 too, and I agree it was bad. There were plenty of times where a piece of environment would just about appear as I walked into it. It does spoil the open world aspect a bit; it kind of spoils the beauty of it, which is the reason why I'd want to explore in the first place. Having said that, I wouldn't tell anyone to <em>not</em> play the game because of it. I found it more annoying than anything, but the game's strengths everywhere else meant I couldn't put it down. Would you discourage people from playing the console version, because of the frame rate issues?
</p><p><strong>MD:</strong> No, not at all, and I expect it's something that can be fixed. The buggy frame rate was an annoyance, but the general feel of the game's world, its tangibility, and its characters, are more than worthy of celebration and recommendation. I think it's a fantastic example of how interactive fiction can work, without being broken down to basic Twine-like affairs, or the sometimes stale-feeling Telltale model we've become accustomed to.
</p><p><em>Firewatch</em> is a great argument for gaming becoming an ever more inclusive medium, too. Not only is it captivating narratively, but its controls are simple, and there's never any "real" threat – you cannot "fail" the game. However clumsy you think you are with a controller, you will get through this, and in not too long a period of time, too. Does this mean it runs the risk of getting flack from, let's say, "hardcore" gamer types for being a title made mainly for "filthy casuals"? I mean, fuck anyone who thinks that way anyway – games are for everyone, it's just whether or not you choose to engage with them – but I'd actually hate for people who just play CoD or FIFA usually to not at least give this a look, y'know? It feels like a gateway game – an easy way into a genre that, when done right, is probably the most rewarding of all gaming experiences.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/05/wood-you-kindly-a-critical-conversation-about-firewatch-750-body-image-1454695104-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="2048" data-original-height="1152" data-model-id="142945" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/05/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/05/" data-image-filename="wood-you-kindly-a-critical-conversation-about-firewatch-750-body-image-1454695104.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p><strong>EQ:</strong> I certainly think the frame rate problems take away from the exploration aspect. However, its story, the way <em>Firewatch</em> deals with relationships, how the game stays with you long after you've completed it, those are things that shouldn't be missed just because it has a few technical issues.
</p><p>It is very innovative, especially the lack of being able to die or lose, which means that the momentum never gets lost, you never feeling the need to put the controller down due to any frustration. I agree that this a game that certainly promotes inclusion, the main reason for playing appealing to anyone who loves a good story, which most of us do. I can see that some people will moan about the lack of combat, the fact that no "skill" is really involved, but I don't get why. <em>Firewatch</em> isn't a traditional game, you can't measure how good you are it, there's no competitive edge to it. It's more of an interactive experience that could be played by anyone, like you said, the controls being simple and easy to learn.
</p><p>Games like these could certainly encourage more non-gamers to play, showing people whose perceptions of games are that they're all violence and sport. It shows that the medium has grown into a much more diverse beast. Also, I know that people have their opinions about games like this, and that's fine, but if individuals call <em>Firewatch</em> shit just because it's different or "not a real game", well, that's fucking stupid.
</p><p>I think issues will also be made about the length, sadly. It's relatively short, but it's also not too expensive and to be honest, I don't think I could have coped going through the game for longer than it ran. It was timed perfectly.
</p><p><strong>MD:</strong> Yep, I'm agreed on it being the perfect length, which is why I'm so sure it'd make a great novel. Maybe I should get on the phone to Campo Santo.
</p><p><strong>EQ:</strong> I think you should, or maybe write some fan fiction for what happens to the characters next. Actually, sod you, I fancy giving that a whirl...

</p><p><strong>MD: </strong>Fight you for it. But, to wrap this up, it's a very simple game, at its core, isn't it? But a very affecting one, too. And I think it'll stand up as one of 2016's best for finding that balance between exposure and emotion so very sweetly. I never grew tired of the backtracking, which does happen, because while the game world is big, it's not so big that you don't soon know your way about without the map. And also, the sprint function is a great inclusion – perhaps essential after the fuss that followed <em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/gamings-gentle-apocalypse-on-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-and-submerged-633" target="_blank">Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</a></em>'s slow pace? I'd happily recommend the game to anyone, not least of all because it can be finished inside, I guess, four hours.
</p><p>It's much the same as <em><a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-makers-of-mobile-hit-80-days-on-the-importance-of-amazing-ui-852" target="_blank">80 Days</a></em>, in that even if you think you hate video games, or simply haven't been around them for years, it's something that you can get into and be a part of without it actually feeling too "game-y", if that makes any sense?
</p><p>In conclusion: <em>I really like it</em>, basically. And I'm guessing that you do, too.
</p><p><strong>EQ:</strong> Yes, it's a very simple game, there's no real learning curve with the controls and you don't really do anything apart from walk, talk and pick things up. However, it's also incredible. I think it will certainly hold up as one of 2016's most surprising triumphs, the way it tugs at your emotions being like nothing else I've ever played, which is hugely impressive when you consider that <em>Firewatch</em> is a game with almost no physical human contact.
</p><p>I didn't mind the backtracking either, and I also didn't mind being lost, which happened a few times. What I <em>did</em> mind was being lost when I was under pressure – not because it frustrated me, but because I wanted to know where I was going so I could run like the wind! In fact, getting lost only added to the intensity of certain situations, getting my map out and tracking myself being the last thing on my mind when panicked. It's easy enough to get around the world, as like you said it's not huge, but there are some situations where you really don't want to cover your face, which your map does. The run feature was a godsend. <em>Firewatch</em> needed that extra energy at times, and I felt being able to run was vital.
</p><p>I would definitely recommend this game to, well, anyone. The fact that you can just sit down and complete it in a few hours makes it ideal for people who want a short burst of interesting fun. And like you said, it's accessible. Sure, it has game mechanics, which is why it's classed as a <em>video game</em>, but it's the narrative that's the real star here, making it more of an interactive story experience than anything.
</p><p>I loved <em>Firewatch</em> and part of me really wishes I could erase my memory of it, just so I could play through the story again. It's that good.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Editor's Note: Meet VICE's newest political correspondent, Bun B. You might know him as the Houston, Texas–based rapper, professor, and activist who's one half of the legendary UGK. </i><em>He's reporting from the ground in New Hampshire, covering the state's presidential primary. His first dispatch is below, and check back for more in the next few days.</em><br></p><p>New Hampshire. The Granite State. Home of the Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales and the nation's laxest seatbelt laws. And <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/romney-family-summer-vacation-photos-2012-7?op=1" target="_blank">occasionally, Mitt Romney's family. </a>And one of, if not <em>the</em> whitest place in America. It also happens to be the first place in the United States where registered voters get to select their respective party candidate in a presidential primary. The Iowa caucuses are actually where the first votes are cast and the first rumblings about who likes who begins. But that process is some whole other shit that quite honestly I couldn't explain to you if you had a gun to my head. </p><p>The primaries, on the other hand, are good old fashioned American voting. Step in the booth, close the curtain, and make your choice. And New Hampshire residents (New Hampshirians?) take it super fucking seriously. So the candidates in turn take New Hampshire super fucking seriously. And the media goes wherever the candidates go, so they too get amped the fuck up about it. And I'm here to cover the whole fucking circus.
</p><p>Granted, I don't come from the world of journalism, but I am a writer and a lot of the issues I address in my songs are in line with the issues we expect the future commander in chief to care about. Now that doesn't make me a journalist or anything like that. I understand and respect journalism, and those reporters who are devoted to their job. So I'm not here to belittle them or their profession by any means. I'm just here to observe it all, the good and the bad of everything. The speeches. The handshakes. The kissing of babies. The kissing of asses.
</p><p>Our first stop Sunday is Cactus Jack's Grill & Watering Hole, in Manchester, which doesn't know whether or not it wants to be a Mexican restaurant or not. Three flags fly overhead. One of them is the Texas state flag, which makes no sense to me at all since I've never seen a cactus in Texas in my life. I'm not saying there aren't some near Waco, or near the border, but a cactus isn't distinctly Texan. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will stop by at some point and speak before the Super Bowl.</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454961947.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="900" data-original-height="600" data-model-id="143678" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454961947.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="photo-credit">All photos by Jessica Lehrman</p><p>It's pretty packed inside, and I can't tell if the people are here for Christie or to watch the game. The Christie team is easy to spot, though, sticking out like sore thumbs in chinos and North Face jackets among the working-class New England people in their random sports gear. The scattered reporters and their impeccable, camera-ready hair are even easier to spot. Their glistening veneers light up the room better than the neon sign on the wall of a cactus wearing a 10-gallon hat. Again, I don't get the reference, but we are about as far from Texas in the continental United States as one can get, so I understand that their view of the rest of America might be slightly skewed. As the governor's state police protection rounds the bar for the 15th time and cameramen set up their tripods while their producers look for the best angles, I take a sip of my watermelon cilantro margarita and wait for the Big Man.</p><p>I talk to some of the staff working the bar, and most of them don't seem to care much about the circus that's been going on around them for the last few months. They're in the service industry, so their main concern is that it brings in business. One waitress told me it doesn't affect her one way or the other if a candidate comes in to the bar. As she said, she's just trying to pay her mortgage. But I wonder if she knows Christie's platform. I wonder if she agrees with his views. Hell, I wonder if she cares about politics at all. I also wonder if she did have concerns, would she be allowed to voice them? Or could she lose her job? If she expresses her political affiliation, will it cost her tips? These are the things I ponder while watching Seal sing in the Super Bowl pre-game show, and commentators wax poetic about Peyton Manning's swan song above a logo for Turkish Airlines and against a backdrop of the Golden Gate bridge on the TVs above the bar. </p><p>It's at this moment that Christie walks into Cactus Jack's, accompanied by Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland. For all the blustering that I've seen on TV, Christie is a much calmer and more subdued individual in person. He introduces himself as Chris to everyone inside, including me. None of the overbearing posturing he displays on camera is evident this afternoon. He's in retail politician mode, and he wears it well.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454961970.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="900" data-original-height="600" data-model-id="143679" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454961970.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p>That's in sharp contrast to the next thing I see. An older white man walks in. He has a long grey beard. He is soft-spoken, but confident. And he has a boot on his head. You read right: A boot. He <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/someone-finally-made-a-documentary-about-vermin-supreme-324" target="_blank">calls himself Vermin Supreme</a>, which is the best non-Wu-Tang simulator name ever created. He's apparently a regular on the New Hampshire political scene. He runs on a campaign of universal dental care and  riding free ponies powered by zombies into the future. Interesting as fuck for sure. Meanwhile, a small circle of people makes its way around the bar with Christie at the center, while the media forms a larger circle around them. He then makes the rounds again, stopping at every table and group twice. Reporters follow behind and interviews everyone he touches, asking how he smelled, how soft or hard his hands were, if they'll be posting their pictures with Christie on Facebook or Instagram, etc. Nothing about the issues. Nothing about their concerns. Interesting.</p><p>Our next stop is shorter. It's sold as Marco Rubio's Super Bowl watch party but it's far from it. For starters, there's only one fucking TV to be found in the whole building, which makes it hard for a room full of 300 people to watch a televised sporting event. It's basically Rubio on stage in what appears to be a gymnastics center or karate dojo, surrounded by press and supporters. Since <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/what-we-learned-from-ted-cruzs-iowa-victory-over-donald-trump" target="_blank">his third place finish in Iowa</a>, Rubio's momentum and coverage has increased substantially, and that's pretty clear here in New Hampshire. The venue is larger than Christie's, as is the crowd of supporters and press. Dozens of shutterbugs surround the stage fighting for pics of Rubio.</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454962029.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="900" data-original-height="600" data-model-id="143680" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454962029.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="">Rubio's handlers are also more intense. One guy dressed in black and smelling like authority is regulating the stage area in a hardbody style of doormanship I haven't seen since Suge Knight showed up at the Source Awards in NYC. They want no videographers on stage, only still photos. He tries to shut me down, but my VICE press pass stops him in his tracks like a smile from Medusa. I meet Jim, originally from Chicago. He's been in New Hampshire for 25-plus years and collects signatures of presidential candidates on two-dollar bills. I ask if he does this for all the candidates and he replies that he only gets signatures from the ones he likes. He takes his signed Rubio bill and adds it to a collection that includes former presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.</p><p>Rubio signs every poster and poses for every picture in typical political fashion. But he is slightly more approachable in person than I thought he would be. He engages with people. He maintains eye contact through every interaction and stays longer than his people would like. I know most of this is part of the show, but I still get the feeling that if he wasn't a politician on the opposite side of everything I stand for we'd make great drinking buddies.</p><p>Since there's only one TV and no liquor, we wrap up with Rubio and head back to our hotel to watch the big game. At check-in, we noticed Jeb Bush sitting in an SUV outside, so we knew we were in the right place. Upon returning to the hotel, we found ourselves invited to a Super Bowl viewing party hosted by the 2016 New Hampshire Presidential Primary Party, which is dedicated to making sure that the state continues to get the first presidential primary on the Republican side.</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454962065.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="900" data-original-height="931" data-model-id="143681" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="bun-b-new-hampshire-primary-dispatch-1-body-image-1454962065.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="">It is without question the quietest room I've ever been in where there was a sporting event playing on the TV and an open bar. Hell, scratch the TV part. Who's quiet at a party with an open bar? Republican delegates that's who. We are with the upper crust of the GOP, so the spread is A-1. I meet our host, Republican National Committee member Steve Duprey, a guy with a million dollar smile and I assume the bank account to match. His warm and welcoming demeanor seems  very genuine. As he leaves to entertain his guests, I scan the conference room and realize it's filled with some of the most powerful people in the Republican Party. How I got in here is anybody's guess, but I'm in this bitch so fuck it, let's mingle.</p><p>Most of the reporters here are still reeling from Iowa. A good meal, a stiff drink, and a football game is the perfect way to wind down. I watch Queen Bey rock the halftime show, while older white women quietly observe 20-plus black women shaking their asses in synchronicity. Meanwhile, Steve, the self-appointed "Secretary of Fun," continues to make us all feel at home. </p><p>As I make my way upstairs with a belly full of short rib and jasmine rice, I reminisce about my first day in New Hampshire. I'm enjoying the process and my access, but today was just the pre-game. Shit is about to get real. So let me smoke one and get some rest, because on Monday, we start early and end late.</p>

</p><p class="photo-credit">Mike Martin, on the beach in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Photo by Meredith Hoffman</p><p>A joint between his lips, toes in the sand, Mike Martin looked like just another dude chilling on the beach in Puerto Rico. But as the 47-year-old Rastafarian blew smoke in my direction, he outlined his vision of justice: legal weed in the US territory.
</p><p>"Legalization is coming," Martin told me. "The last several days have made that clear."
</p><p>Martin, who sits on the board of Puerto Rico's preeminent pro-marijuana non-profit Foundation Free Juana, was referring to the government's recent moves toward decreasing its draconian weed penalties. Two weeks ago, the governor <a href="http://www.univision.com/puerto-rico/wlii/noticias/uso-de-drogas/gobernador-de-puerto-rico-indulto-a-jeremy-ruiz-quien-cumplia-carcel-por-fumar-marihuana" target="_blank">pardoned Jeremy Ruiz Tomassini</a>, a 24-year-old man sentenced to four years in prison after cops caught him smoking near a school. The pardon, granted January 25, came 13 months after Free Juana delivered a petition to Governor Alejandro Padilla that the punishment, issued in 2014, was unreasonably harsh.

</p><p>"We made an official petition and held a 'free Jeremy' vigil at the governor's mansion and my band played there," said Martin. "Then this January the governor came to Vieques for Three Kings Day to pass gifts to children in the park, and I went to talk with him. I introduced myself and said I play with Free Juana. He took me aside and asked me, 'How much time has Jeremy been inside?' He was worried about it."
</p><p>Within days, Padilla released Ruiz Tomassini from prison, claiming he was <a href="http://www.univision.com/puerto-rico/wlii/noticias/uso-de-drogas/gobernador-de-puerto-rico-indulto-a-jeremy-ruiz-quien-cumplia-carcel-por-fumar-marihuana" target="_blank">not an enforcement priority</a>.</p><p>Ruiz Tomassini's pardon was just one indicator that Puerto Rico is edging away from its notoriously harsh marijuana laws. Current legislation allows judges to sentence people up to five years for nominal possession, and up to ten years for possession near a recreational area (public use spaces like parks and schools). But recently politicians have begun changing their approaches towards the drug and activists like Martin see it as an opportunity to pave the way toward legalization.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/on-the-front-lines-of-puerto-ricos-movement-to-legalize-marijuana-body-image-1454961649.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="930" data-original-height="1400" data-model-id="143677" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="on-the-front-lines-of-puerto-ricos-movement-to-legalize-marijuana-body-image-1454961649.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit">Mike Martin sporting the Free Juana logo. Photo by Meredith Hoffman<br></p><p>There are already signs of progress: Governor Padilla signed an executive order last summer to legalize weed for medicinal purposes, and just last month the government unveiled its <a href="http://www.univision.com/noticias/marihuana-medicinal/presentan-reglamento-sobre-marihuana-medicinal-en-puerto-rico" target="_blank">set of rules</a> to regulate the cultivation, distribution, and use of the substance. Growers, who can be based in Puerto Rico or abroad, will apply for permission from the government; patients will receive medical marijuana ID cards, after receiving a doctor's approval that they have one of several "debilitating conditions." If all goes according to plan, medical marijuana is expected to be available in Puerto Rico by the end of the year. </p><p>Padilla also loosened Puerto Rico's penalties for small amounts of recreational possession, when he signed an <a href="http://www.telemundopr.com/noticias/Cambios-en-proceso-327691371.html" target="_blank">executive order</a> in September advising judges not to imprison people caught with fewer than six grams of weed.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/on-the-front-lines-of-puerto-ricos-movement-to-legalize-marijuana-body-image-1454966333.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="800" data-original-height="1007" data-model-id="143690" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="on-the-front-lines-of-puerto-ricos-movement-to-legalize-marijuana-body-image-1454966333.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p class="photo-credit">Mike Martin poses with Governor Padilla in Vieques. Photo courtesy of Mike Martin<br></p><p>Meanwhile, Puerto Rico's pro-marijuana movement has taken off in the past few years. Both Free Juana and another organization, Decriminalization, have become influential on the island. Both have amplified their reach, garnering more media attention and support from the public, while <a href="http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/gobernador-ordena-viabilizar-uso-medicinal-de-productos-derivados-del-cannabis" target="_blank">US states with legalized weed have also helped pave the way</a>, emboldening Puerto Rican politicians like Padilla to support marijuana activists.</p><p>"When Free Juana had its first 4/20 rally there were just 20 or 30 people who were brave enough to march towards the capital. We thought we could be arrested," Martin recalled of the protest in 2013. Now, multiple bands play each year, two senators sponsor the rallies, and Free Juana has grown from a group of local activists into an official foundation.</p><p><strong><em>Watch Kings of Cannabis, our documentary about weed kingpin Arjan Roskam and his quest for the rarest strains.</em></strong>

</p><p>"In the past two years, there has been an opening," said Rafael Torruellla, director of Decriminalization and of the drug education and research organization Intercambios Puerto Rico. "There's a marijuana movement here in Puerto Rico that only now is gaining more steam."
</p><p>One reason is the economy, according to Torruella, a social psychologist with a PhD from City University of New York. Puerto Rico is currently <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/puerto-ricos-slide" target="_blank">£48 billion in debt</a>, and a regulated drug market in Puerto Rico would ease the island's economic crisis.
</p><p>"This difficult economic time is when we should start looking at what is failing," Torruella told me. "We're trying to move drug policy from the law and order side to where it should belong, which is in the public health side."</p><p>Torruella said the governor's executive orders are "very significant" but the job is hardly finished. Puerto Rico's Congress needs to act to ensure the orders become law.
</p><p>"Medical marijuana is an executive order, not a law, which is important because the next governor can dismantle the whole system," Torruella warned.
</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/yes-shes-tried-it" target="_blank"><em>The Texas Republican Grandma Who Wants to Legalize Weed</em></a></strong><br>
</p><p>Already, Padilla's opponents are trying to block the order in court. Members of the political party Partido Nuevo Progresista have requested a judge issue an injunction preventing medical marijuana distribution. The judge has not yet released a decision.
</p><p>The current medical marijuana standards could also be better, Torruella said: There should be provisions for patients to cultivate their own crops, for the market to favor local growers, doctors, and cooperative farms. </p><p>"There are some foreign pharmacies that are establishing themselves to sell. There has been a big controversy on how business will be done. The  seems already to be favoring big pharmaceutical companies," Torruella said. "There are many questions that remain about how this system is going to work."
</p><p>There have been other attempts to pass marijuana legislation: Senator Miguel Pereira <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/20/puerto-rico-debates-legalizing-marijuana-use/2100075/" target="_blank">proposed a bill</a> to decriminalize possessing small amounts marijuana, but it has been stalled in the House of Representatives since 2013. Opponents of the law were so irate they <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/20/puerto-rico-debates-legalizing-marijuana-use/2100075/" target="_blank">demanded Pereira's resignation</a>.
</p><p>As conservative Puerto Rican politicians demonize the drug and the island takes baby steps towards legalization, Martin stays patient, aided by his herbs on the seashore.
</p><p>"It doesn't matter how long it takes for legalization. It's going to happen," Martin told me, taking a seat in a lawn chair beside the water. "We're not in a hurry. We just want to bring consciousness and decriminalize and medicalize it, and eventually it will be legal."

<description><![CDATA[The story of Atlantium, a Non-Territorial Global Sovereign Entity near Sydney that almost went to war with another micro nation over a dispute about stamps.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outward on the M5 from Sydney, under the wind turbines that look like spinning Mercedes badges on enormous stems, through towns where life and death is marked by the newly painted population number on faded green signs, you will arrive at a bungalow flying a tricolour flag.
</p><p>You have arrived at Atlantium, the smallest country in Australia. The only micro nation on AirBnB.
</p><p>"Atlantium is not a micro nation," the nation's Emperor, Georgivs II, corrects me as we arrive.
</p><p>"It's a Non-Territorial Global Sovereign Entity," he continues, offering to make tea for my girlfriend and I using the country's gas stove.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013828-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="1060" data-model-id="143849" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013828.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>Art Deco portraits cover the walls and a mixture of travel, science fiction and local interest books pack the shelves. Inside the Empire's one building for guests (the Emperor stays next door in a corrugated metal-sheeted shed), it's not too dissimilar to any other AirBnB experience.
</p><p>There are some distinct features. The heat is oppressive here in Atlantium. Walking into it is like opening an industrial oven door; the skin sings in pain. The place is silent in that way silence can be very loud. All you can really hear is the stridulation of locusts and the warble of Atlantium's various bird species; crimson rosellas, cockatoo and owls.

The giant timber pyramid, for example – the only of its kind in Australia – or the column made up of an eagle statue sitting on top of a gold sphere.<br>
</p><p>Tea prepared, the Emperor Georgivs II – or George Francis Cruickshank, as he goes by outside the nation's boundary lines – rattles the wind chimes and takes us all back to his mother's backyard in Sydney, where he and his cousins, Geoff and Claire, created Atlantium in 1981.
</p><p>"We were living in the tail end of the Cold War. It was a very confrontational world, and we had this idea that maybe we should set up our own country. I wrote the constitution and we developed the postage stamps and flags and all that sort of stuff. It was largely an intellectual exercise; a black and white dotted line in the corner of my mother's backyard in suburban Sydney. I think that black and white line is still there."
</p><p>Back then, Atlantium was a reflection of the young Emperor's ideals. It had no territory, only values and paraphernalia. In fact, it was the paraphernalia that, in part, went some way to establishing the nation it is today. George and his cousins created and issued postage stamps, which attracted stamp enthusiasts, which attracted other micro nations. Recognition grew for what was essentially a product of the imagination of a group of teenagers.
</p><p>As time passed, however, and George went to University in Wagga Wagga, his cousins' interest fell away. Yet the idea of Atlantium lived on in his mind. He calls it his obsession; a thread through his entire life. Naturally, Atlantium matured as George did – or, as he puts it: "It evolved as I evolved. Atlantium was a way of expressing my broadly progressive political views in an age and at a time when progressivism was under attack from all comers."
</p><p>Trouble was, it's difficult to have your progressive notions taken seriously by anyone when half your country is a bedroom. So when, by chance, a friend bought a piece of land near Reid's Flat in 1999, the young Emperor began to visit in the hope of terraforming the nation. By 2008, he became a co-owner and the Atlantium as we see it today was finally free to be realised; the vision unleashed from his mind.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013898-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="1060" data-model-id="143851" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013898.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>The pyramid was constructed, the column erected. If the regality of its ceremonial sites and the Emperor's own title gives the nation a sense of pompousness, George is quick to dispel it. The monarchy he's created for himself has more to do with the message than madness.
</p><p>"It's based on Australian humour," he says. "If you're trying to communicate a serious message and do that with a smile on your face, you're perceived as not threatening to people in power, or to people you're communicating with more generally."
</p><p>It's clearly a technique that works, allowing George his proudest moment: being asked to appear as the Emperor on a national morning television show in Sydney, and then taking the opportunity to broach the subject of abortion and assisted suicide.
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013707-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="1060" data-model-id="143848" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013707.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>Looking around the Empire it's easy to see the irony at play, whether it's in the postcards, the pyramid guarded by Sphinx or even the stamps, which feature a Soviet-style portrait of the Emperor that wouldn't look out of place in the Gosha Rubchinskiy SS16 look-book.
</p><p>It was stamps, also, that led Atlantium into its first and last conflict.
</p><p>With the attention he garnered from the original Atlantium stamps, George expanded to cover other micro nations. For the 15th anniversary of Hutt River Province, Australia's oldest micro nation, he created commemorative postage stamps. Little did he know, this would become an act of war.
</p><p>British-born Alex Brackstone came out to Australia in the 1950s. He worked as a circus monkey trainer and uranium prospector before finally buying up a piece of property in Southern Australia and seceding to ensure a part of the continent would remain forever British. Such was his devotion to both his homeland and his micro nation, The Province of Bumbunga, he planted strawberry plants there in the shape of the British Isles. Brackstone would later become one of many to follow the issue of George's commemorative Hutt River Province stamps.
</p><p>" wrote to us and basically said, 'If you do the same thing with my micro nation, I'll be hauling you into court.' And so I said: 'Bugger you,'" says George. "There was a series of correspondences of increasing escalation, and we did actually declare war on The Province of Bumbunga. As a consequence we've completely renounced the use of state force. We have no army. We have no military significance. We have a non-confrontational relationship with our neighbour Australia."
</p><p>Later, as the Emperor fixes himself up in a suit and a sash bearing the Empire's flag, it's hard not to feel like the act is a bit laboured. The costume a kind of ritual he has to enact. How do you end a 34-year private joke?<br>
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013935-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="1060" data-model-id="143852" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/09/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/09/" data-image-filename="empire-of-atlantium-micro-nation-australia-body-image-1455013935.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>In the morning we share another cup of tea and I manage to send a postcard to the office using the nation's official postbox.
</p><p>Before we go, I ask George about the landscape that Atlantium has become a part of and how that plays into his 15-year-old vision for the world. His answer goes some way to defining Atlantium in the way I think we felt while staying there.
</p><p>"I don't know whether Atlantium is tied up in some way with my desire to make a mark on the world, but I suspect it is, because that's what I was really doing when I was 15," he says. "I was conceiving things that were going to somehow make a mark on the world, and when I think about it, honestly, that's really what I've been trying to do all my life with all of the things that I do. Maybe that's just a way of me raging against the infinity of knowing that my time here is finite, and that once you're gone, you're gone."
</p><p>Before I went to Atlantium I had my reservations about venturing into the Australian wilderness to meet a man who'd deliberately set himself apart from the world. But that's not what Atlantium is at all. It's a man's imprint of his vision on the landscape. A teenage ambition – the kind most of us come across years later in our childhood bedrooms, sketched on the back of notepads or scrawled in Tipp-Ex across backpacks – realised in the shape of yellow bungalow, a pyramid and a collection of postage stamps.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="photo-credit has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/reality-television-will-not-stop-until-james-arg-argent-is-killed-in-glorious-hd-406-body-image-1454937792-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1280" data-original-height="716" data-model-id="143495" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="reality-television-will-not-stop-until-james-arg-argent-is-killed-in-glorious-hd-406-body-image-1454937792.jpg" class="vmp-image">A Portrait Of The Artist In Flight (Screengrab via Channel 4)
</p><p>Channel 4's <em>The Jump</em> has never really appealed to me before as a televisual prospect, because, what: I want to watch Chloe Madeley ski a little while Davina McCall does her young-at-heart-auntie-really-wants-to-get-this-wake-popping-because-that's-what-he-would-have-wanted bit on the sidelines? No, no thank you, thank you but not at all. But then I found out it was responsible for this seven little seconds of perfection, video-as-art, the closest this generation will get to a Sistine Chapel – James 'Arg' Argent, sliding on his arse onto a gigantic distant airbed – and now I'm rethinking my stance:
</p><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en" data-twitter-extracted-i1454937744671763647="true">Amazing. Who needs skis when you can just sit down and slide on your behind? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheJump?src=hash">#TheJump</a> <a href="https://t.co/7aLmXlGqqe">https://t.co/7aLmXlGqqe</a><br>— Channel 4 (@Channel4) <a href="https://twitter.com/Channel4/status/693886999548153856">January 31, 2016</a>
</blockquote><p>First three seconds are classic latent Arg: hands firmly on his knees to fend off the terror of what's to come; bedazzled 'A' emblazoned on his leotard that, in the face of the cold prospect of jumping off a 20ft ski slope, looks so foolish, so hubristic; the inscrutable face of focus, repeating the mantras of his ski instructors – 'bum out, Arg, knees pliant' – on a loop inside his head. And then, somewhere indistinct between the third and fourth seconds, something inexplicable happens inside James 'Arg' Argent's body: his muscles go liquid and contort inside his skin, machinations unknown cause him to ease over backwards, his mind does not allow him to stop, and then, emotionlessly, silently, James 'Arg' Argent slides on his arse and off into the abyss, ski tips meeting for one perfect moment as he arcs towards the ground. Again:
</p><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en" data-twitter-extracted-i1454937744671763647="true">Amazing. Who needs skis when you can just sit down and slide on your behind? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheJump?src=hash">#TheJump</a> <a href="https://t.co/7aLmXlGqqe">https://t.co/7aLmXlGqqe</a><br>— Channel 4 (@Channel4) <a href="https://twitter.com/Channel4/status/693886999548153856">January 31, 2016</a>
</blockquote><p>"Oh no," Davina McCall says. "Oh no. Up, and: backwards! <em>Backwards</em>!" And Arg hits the pillow like a brick thrown in the sea.
</p><p>The Jump injury list, as of press date (February 8, 2k16): Rebecca Adlington, peak condition former Olympic swimmer: dislocated shoulder; Linford Christie, peak condition former Olympic lunchbox ferrier: pulled hamstring; Beth Tweddle, peak condition former Olympic gymnast: broken back; Tina Hobley, <em>Holby City</em> actress: twice-broken and dislocated elbow; Sid Owen off of <em>EastEnders</em>: unidentified but agonising thigh injury. Somehow, Argent survives. Somehow, Argent lives on.
</p><blockquote><strong><em>On NOISEY: </em></strong><a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/kurupt-fm-stormzy-big-narstie-and-newham-generals-smashed-up-a-sold-out-london-show" target="_blank"><strong><em>Kurupt FM Are More Than Just A Comedy Show</em></strong></a>
</blockquote><p>In a way, <em>The Jump</em> is the natural conclusion for our reality TV bloodlust, the first tentative steps towards a dystopian end game: shapeless low-level celebrities and peak condition former athletes, gaunt and penniless on the thin gruel of post-Olympic non-sporting life, race each other to see who can get most brutally hurt on live TV. Based on the current injury list, there is an approximate 25% chance that <em>Jump</em> contestants will get badly hurt: a 1 in 14 probability that they will need surgery to fuse and repair their damaged spines. And yet they cue up to jump artlessly off a ski slope on primetime Channel 4. They cheerfully offer their bound and broken limbs to Davina McCall in the interstitial ski lodge and say: <em>I'm gutted I can't compete</em>. All the pre-ad roll oompa bands and Sarah Harding laughing at a hot chocolate are mere distraction: we are truly here to see Tamara Beckwith burn her face off going nose-first down a ski cross route; we're here to see James 'Arg' Argent dislocate all of his limbs at once, splayed like a starfish in one perfect gravity-free moment mid-air, slumping to the ground like an octopus tossed loosely out of the sea.
</p><p>When celebrities agree to compete on <em>The Jump</em> they are essentially saying: <em>my career is at a point where I must hurt myself for money.</em>
</p><blockquote><strong><em>On VICE Sports: </em></strong><a href="https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/article/a-brief-history-of-footballers-in-pop-music" target="_blank"><strong><em>A Brief History Of Footballers In Pop Music</em></strong></a>
</blockquote><p>Arg is an interesting prospect, as a human and as a celebrity. In real life, up close, he's more handsome than you might expect: perfectly baked tan, thick shiny hair, strong white teeth, like a thoroughbred horse who laughs at fart jokes. In the Acknowledgements section of his autobiography, he thanks the Chicken Cottage, South Woodford, just behind his nan. Arg. A name that's not a name, a sound better burped than spoken. Arg. In his book, which I have read cover-to-cover, he details in harrowing detail a moment when Gemma Collins and him did some hand stuff at a fat camp. Arg. In her book, there is no corresponding chapter. Arg. The pinnacle of the reality TV punching bag, giggling maniacally like the kid at the back of the maths class who is only in top set thanks to a clerical error. Arg. He's done <em>The Spa</em>, a show about ham-fisted celebrities learning to massage the general public; he's done <em>Sugar Free Farm</em>, a show where celebrities go to a farm and don't eat sugar; he's done <em>TOWIE</em>, first as the Hardy to Mark Wright's 'awlright gels?' Laurel, then as some sort of pathological wearer of ill-fitting jumpers, staring at his feet while his girlfriend cries loudly at him or laughing at the side of a pool in Marbella with Diags. Arg. And now, so surely down the reality TV path is he, <em>The Jump</em>: throwing himself to near death off the top of a ski slope, arse on the snow, torso dragging helplessly behind his flailing feet, all for our amusement. The clown prince of ITV2. The most nailed-on Jacamo spokesmodel since Freddie Flintoff. Again:
</p><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en" data-twitter-extracted-i1454937744671763647="true">Amazing. Who needs skis when you can just sit down and slide on your behind? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheJump?src=hash">#TheJump</a> <a href="https://t.co/7aLmXlGqqe">https://t.co/7aLmXlGqqe</a><br>— Channel 4 (@Channel4) <a href="https://twitter.com/Channel4/status/693886999548153856">January 31, 2016</a>
</blockquote><p>Ask yourself a question: do you want to watch Arg die? This is where we are heading. Because when he flailed arse-first out of <em>The Jump</em> last night, as his body crushed into the inflatable safety-bed below, he basically said: <em>what is the next reality endeavour for me</em>. His arms clawed at the polythene saving him from death and thought: <em>I could do </em>I'm A Celeb<em>, I suppose</em>. But if ITV2 come up with a format where Arg has to competitively bungee jump against Rustie Lee? Arg is a maybe. Channel 4 come up with an offer to do a docuseries where six celebs get hooked on heroin, Reggie Yates to do the heartfelt flophouse interviews in front of a live studio audience? Arg just needs the say-so from Freemantle, but it looks like it's a yes. And so to a doomed future: James 'Arg' Argent, choking to death on 60 hotdog sausages, trying to break a Guinness speed-eating record in front of Ant and Dec. Is this what you want? Is this what you want, you blood-crazed lunatics? Do you want Arg to die? We are, all of us, complicit in James 'Arg' Argent's inevitable death. His failure on <em>The Jump</em> was just one shaky, inelegant step towards infinite blackness. Only then will we be happy again.

of Microsoft, 
	<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06z1zdt" target="_blank">Bill Gates personally memorised</a> his employees' number plates so
he could keep track of who was arriving late or leaving early. 
	</span>A bit creepy,
perhaps, but endearingly old school – the sort of pathetic scheme a crafty
loafer like George Costanza would get around by leaving a car parked
permanently at work so everyone thinks he's still at his desk.

easy these days. A coldly efficient kind of cyber monitoring is entering the
office that can ensure every keyboard stroke is accounted for, your computer
can be randomly screen-grabbed and even your sleep can be monitored to make
sure you're achieving optimal performance.

motion sensors
	</a></span><span lang="EN-US"> attached to their desks. Staff were informed that the boxes were there to help the
company identify "times of low usage" to save on energy bills. The journalists
kicked up a fuss, believing this move was actually more about picking which staff
members would be laid off as the company downsized, and the sensors were
removed. Buzzfeed
	</span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/telegraph-workplace-sensors#.pxD57yjJNe"> revealed</a></span><span lang="EN-US"> the sense of paranoia the episode has created: "Never before

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Workers'
rebellions remain few and far between, however, while cyber surveillance of our
desks is becoming increasingly common. Relentless monitoring of performance is no longer the preserve of call centres; it's now moved into the wider working world. 
	</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">"There really isn't
much privacy left in the workplace," says Lewis Maltby, director of the US
National Workrights Institute. "You're often being monitored, whether you know
it or not. Employers don't always tell you what they're doing."
	</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Europeans might
assume their privacy is better protected than Americans'. But last month a
chilling decision by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) established a
precedent for employers to sift through your private messages if they suspect
you're slacking.

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The case revolved
around a Romanian engineer who was fired after his company discovered he was
using Yahoo Messenger to chat with his fiancee on a work computer.

working hours".

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Even if you like
your boss, you shouldn't assume your company trusts you or respects your
privacy. Software like Worksnaps allows employers to take regular screenshots
of online activities, count the number of keystrokes made and even capture
webcam images. 
	</span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.worksnaps.net/www/testimonials.shtml">Worksnaps' testimonials</a></span><span lang="EN-US"> reveal

<title>Why Is the UK Suddenly So Obsessed with &#039;Chav Porn&#039;?</title>

<description><![CDATA[There's been a 312 percent increase in British PornHub users searching for "British chav", so we spoke to some experts about why that might be.

<enclosure url="http://vice-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/02/08/british-chav-porn-uk-increase-pornhub-search-1454932443.jpg" type="image/jpg" length="1131"></enclosure>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, PornHub released <a href="http://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-2015-year-in-review" target="_blank">its annual review</a> of the world's sexual quirks. And the world, it turns out, is really into watching other people fuck. In 2015, we as a planet streamed over 4 billion hours of smut on PornHub alone, with the UK ranking second for both overall traffic to the site and page views per capita.
</p><p>None of that came as a huge surprise. Traditionally, humans have had at least a passing interest in doing sex, and many like to supplement that interest by firing up an incognito window, turning the volume down and watching two strangers – or a number of strangers – do sex to one another.
</p><p>Less predictable was that the UK's ninth most popular PornHub search term would be "British chav". Climbing 23 spots since 2014, with searches up 312 percent, there's clearly been a surge of interest in adult actresses playing the role of this working class caricature: the Nickelson-wearing, benefits-cheating ASBO recipient who existed more in the minds of sketch show writers than the actual streets of Britain.
</p><p>Which is odd, because in 2016 the entire concept of a "chav" just seems so dated.
</p><p>After a short time in the spotlight in the mid-2000s, in which ASDA <a href="http://www.confectionerynews.com/Manufacturers/ASDA-bid-for-chav-candy" target="_blank">tried to trademark the word</a> for a range of own-brand sweets, "chav" began to fall out of favour. Commentators and columnists argued that calling someone a chav was tantamount to class abuse; that the word was elitist and patronising; that it wrongfully stereotyped all working class people as feckless and entitled.
</p><p>The average person might not have thought the word to be as charged as that. Teenage Slipknot fans, for instance, used it interchangeably with "townie" or "ned" to describe the kids who wore non-grunger clothes and took the piss out of them for their black nail polish and dragon necklaces, not as a mass indictment of the British working class.
</p><p>However, considering <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13626046" target="_blank">70 percent of TV professionals</a> at the time believed Vicky Pollard – <em>Little Britain</em>'s dystopian "chav" character – to be representative of white working class youth, it's clear the term had become a problem. For politicians and those shaping the media to still be using the word represented a uniquely detached strain of snobbery, a semantic subjugation of millions of working class people.
</p><p>By 2012 – a year after the publication of Owen Jones' critically-acclaimed <em>Chavs: The Demonisation of the Working Class</em> – the word "chav" was one you'd rarely read or hear outside of polemics in the <em>Mail</em> or from the mouth of a culturally detached chat show guest.
</p><p>So why, all these years later, is the word "chav" at the forefront of so many British masturbators' minds?
</p><p>"The chav girl is not someone to take home to meet the family – she's a throwaway fuck," says Chloe Davis, a UK-based porn actress, fetish model and dominatrix. "They're prime fodder for the the middle-aged man who fancies a bit of rough with a lady of easy virtue."
</p><p>The "bit of rough" explanation: problematic – in that fetishising an already problematic stereotype probably isn't the most positive reflection of men in the UK – but also not all that shocking.
</p><p>A member of the upper class being attracted to someone from a lower class is a classic trope in British popular culture, from clandestine courtships in 18th century literature all the way up to Lady Sybil getting off with Branson in <em>Downton Abbey</em>. A survey in 2011 <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/class-exclusive-seven-in-10-of-us-belong-to-middle-britain-2247052.html" target="_blank">found that 71 percent of Brits</a> define themselves as middle class. That "bit of rough" fantasy is all about Britain's complicated relationship with class, so if it's as common among real people as it is among fictional characters – and it almost certainly is – that's a massive amount of middle class people for whom the "bit of rough" would be a working class person. If one of those middle class people wanted a visual aid for their fantasising, what might they search for on a porn website? My guess: a word established in popular culture to sum up a load of imagined cliches about working class people.
</p><p>Dr Laurie Betito, psychologist and sex therapist, takes the theory one step further, alluding to the role class can play in some viewers' taste in porn.
</p><p>"I think chav porn appeals to the basest of instincts, in the sense that it is raw sexuality. There is an element of disrespect – even abuse – in it. The guys view the women in this genre as so 'low class' that they are not deserving of any respect or even pleasantries," she says, bringing to mind the depressingly giant market for "humiliation porn", which is exactly what it sounds like. "We often see the man ordering the woman around," she continues, "telling her what he wants her to do next and frequently referring to her in derogatory terms."
</p><blockquote><strong><em>READ ON BROADLY: <a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-the-porn-star-giving-veterans-blowjobs-to-thank-them-for-their-service" target="_blank">Meet the Porn Star Giving Veterans Blowjobs to Thank Them for Their Service</a></em></strong>
</blockquote><p>There is, of course, another big issue with these so-called "chav porn" videos: the fact that many of the women in them aren't actually dressed to look anything like the stereotypical image of a "chav".
</p><p>For gay guys into the scally gear fetish – the closest equivalent to all this in the gay scene: erotic gratification derived from having sex or wanking in full tracksuits – it's all about the clothes. In <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/scally-lads-v21n2" target="_blank">an interview with VICE</a>, one scally gear fetishist said, "If I'm having sex, it's full gear. I wouldn't even pull a tracksuit down to the knees." In "chav porn", bar the odd person inexplicably wearing a Burberry cap and nothing else, the stars of the videos are just normal British women with no clothes on.
</p><p>So is it that viewers in the UK just want to see something a little more familiar than what American porn studios offer up? Has "chav" become an SEO-friendly byword for the clunkier "literally just show me a normal-looking British person having sex"?
</p><p>"Trends are shifting away from the plastic porn look to real people we recognise from our own lives," says Masie Dee, a porn actress who's well versed in this world, having modelled for "chav porn" shoots in the past. "From an industry perspective, what UK porn does best above all other countries is everyday, natural porn. We shoot all ages, all body types – it is a very inclusive space."
</p><p>The psychology is simple: if the people in the porn look similar to the people the viewer sees on a day-to-day basis, it's far easier for them to mentally insert themselves into the scene – something you'd imagine is pretty desirable, given the enormous selection of POV videos on every single online porn site.
</p><p>"I think what chav porn represents is the sort of council estate, girl next door kind of thing," says William Batchelor, PR for the TV network Television X. "People in the UK are drawn to it because you don't see that in any other country."
</p><p>In 2015, Television X released <em>Chav Life</em>, a five-part series that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has a strong "chavvy" vibe. The company is also responsible for a number of other chav-themed titles, including <em>Chavving It By the Sea</em> (2012) and <em>Council Estate Skanks</em> (2013).
</p><p>However, the focus isn't on "chavs", says Batchelor, but on Britain.
</p><p>"Our content is made for a British audience by British performers in British situations," he says.
</p><p>But with the "chav" stereotype mostly disappearing from the British cultural landscape, do "British situations" really still cover the "chav" thing? Are you saying the concept of "chav" is somehow integral to the UK?
</p><p>"Yeah, but not in a degrading way," says Batchelor. "We want to be the best at British, and I think we couldn't have that without having any chav.'"
</p><p>All of that might go some way to explaining both the proliferation of "chav porn" videos and their general popularity with viewers. But what's behind this sudden and huge rise in people searching for it?

</iframe><p>Imogen Tyler, Professor of Sociology at Lancaster University, draws an interesting parallel between "chav porn" and the rise over the past few years of "poverty porn", a term referring to the media exploitation of people living on benefits – Channel 4's <em>Benefits Street</em> and Channel 5's <em>On Benefits and Proud</em> being two notable examples.
</p><p>For Tyler, the depiction of a very specific type of working class person offered up in shows like this invites a mix of shock and fascination, and the viewer ends up both enthralled and outraged by the subjects of the show. This blend of emotions can play on the viewer's mind and supposedly spark a sort of fetishisation of the people they're watching – in this particular case, those hand plucked to represent some of the cliches typically attributed to the "chav" stereotype.
</p><p>"If we think about pornography historically and socially," says Tyler, "we see that it usually represents taboo desires and fascinations. So these porn search terms reveal something about the fantasy life of our nation and about the constraints – social, political, economic – under which we live."
</p><p>While it might be a bit of a stretch to suggest this interest in "chav porn" is all down to the rise of poverty porn, you can see the link if you look for it. <em>Benefits Street</em>, the show that sparked the poverty porn debate, first aired in January of 2014. By the end of the following year there had been a 312 percent rise in people taking to PornHub to search for "chav porn".
</p><p>In the end, of course, all you can really do is speculate. The above might broadly explain this sudden fascination with "chav porn", but every individual's sexual idiosyncrasies stem from a whole number of personal triggers. And without climbing into the brain of each and every British person to have bashed "British chav" into the PornHub search bar in the past couple of years, I suppose we'll never know why exactly thousands of people have become so enamoured with this relic of British pop culture.

There's the initial tickle in your body, the build up of tension, the suspense, and then suddenly, like a volcanic eruption, you feel the explosion of physical relief. It feels <em>satisfying </em>to sneeze.
</p><p>For some, it's also satisfying to watch other people sneeze. Sexually satisfying even. And these people are discovering online that they're not alone in the community of sneezing, coughing, and cold-and-flu fetishists.
</p><p>"I'm attracted to sneezing, but also other symptoms like coughing, fevers, discomfort. So you might say I'm more of a cold-and-allergies fetishist," said Emma, a 29-year-old from Canada, who's active on a site for sneeze fetishists.
</p><p>As a kid, she remembers taking a special interest in sneezes in books and television – like a scene in the animated <em>Frosty the Snowman </em>movie, where a character "sneezes and shivers from being in the chilled boxcar on the train," or a book about Donald Duck's nephews who get sick, which she "read over and over."
</p><p>Like Emma, Terry, a 21-year-old from the northeastern United States, was interested in sneezing from a very early age, but says "it wasn't until I hit puberty that I recognised my feelings about  were becoming sexual in nature."
	
</p><p>Both Emma and Terry discovered through internet searches in their late teens that the intense feelings they felt throughout childhood were not only a real fetish, but there were also others out there just like them.
</p><p>Online, there are several places for sneeze fetishists to convene: There's <a href="http://www.sneezefetishforum.org/" target="_blank">Sneeze Fetish Forum</a>, a 3,500-member community where people trade stories and observations and tips for coming out. There's a private sub-Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sneezefetish/" target="_blank">r/sneezefetish</a>, for general discussion. There's <a href="http://sneezefurs.org/" target="_blank">The Furry Sneezing Archive</a>, for the intersection of sneezing and anthropomorphics. And plenty of web 1.0-style sites, like <a href="http://tos.tarotgal.net/page1.html" target="_blank">Tarot of Sneezing</a>, where <a href="http://tos.tarotgal.net/first.html" target="_blank">an early post</a> from the webmaster acknowledged that "there are so many things out there now relating to sneezing – chat rooms and forums, so you can interact with others who like sneezing."</p><p>The point? If you're into sneezing, you're not alone.
</p><p>"I think the first time I masturbated was while listening to the sounds of someone sneezing on a fetish site," said Emma. "Suddenly I was discovering a multitude of online areas that had people who were writing and sharing the same kind of fantasies that I'd made up in my head for a decade."<br>

</p><p>Lyna, a 21-year-old from rural Missouri, became a nurse after she discovered her sneezing fetish. She was quick to clarify that she doesn't get off on watching her patients sneeze, but says her fetish played into her desire to be a caretaker.
</p><p>"Most sneezes really don't turn me on at all – probably a good thing, since I work in the medical field," said Lyna, "I prefer 'tough guys' with colds who deny that they're sick until they can't anymore, with long buildups and trying to hold back the sneeze, even trying to talk while fighting the need to sneeze. I also love how a man's voice gets hoarse when he's sick, so it's deeper and gravelly. I enjoy being the caretaker."
</p><p>"A lot of what I find attractive has to do with a situation or a continued loss of control," said Emma, "So a single sneeze or cough, while occasionally appreciated, is simply mundane enough for me to often ignore. If someone is completely down and out with cold symptoms or totally non-functional because of hay fever, that's far more interesting than a single sneeze."
</p><p>Compared to people with fetishes like bondage, BDSM, or pup play, the sneeze fetishists I spoke to were intensely private about their sex lives. They don't hold meet-ups or conventions, and aside from the chat rooms and internet forums where they talk to each other, everyone I spoke to said they kept their fetish a secret.
</p><p>"I come from a very Southern Baptist family," said Lyna, "and the area I live in is a very closed-minded small town, so unless my fetish was something to do with big trucks, no one here will ever know."</p><p>According to Dr. Chris Donaghue, sex therapist and author of <em>Sex Outside the Lines: Authentic Sexuality in a Sexually Dysfunctional Culture, </em>it's important to remove the shame and stigma from people with unusual desires. "That's the core problem here – the shame they feel , not the actual act," said Donaghue.</p><p>If there's one place where the sneeze fetishists felt totally free of shame, it's online. All the people interviewed for this story described the internet as an outlet for them to express desires freely, and an escape from the isolation in their daily lives.
</p><p>"I think if the internet did not exist, I would have never identified my feelings as a fetish – perhaps never even as a sexual interest," said Emma.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/05/why-the-hell-do-747-percent-of-muslims-support-donald-trump-body-image-1454639115-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="1800" data-original-height="1185" data-model-id="142629" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/05/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/05/" data-image-filename="why-the-hell-do-747-percent-of-muslims-support-donald-trump-body-image-1454639115.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p class="photo-credit">Photo via Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/5440388253" target="_blank">Gage Skidmore</a>
</p><p>When the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released its <a href="http://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/13365-cair-releases-results-of-muslim-voter-survey-ahead-of-primary-elections.html" target="_blank">2016 voter survey</a> this week, the first few results in the report were illuminating, if not all that surprising. For 73 percent of registered Muslim voters, Islamophobia is the number one concern, up from third place in 2014. About the same percentage of Muslim voters plan to vote for one of the two Democrats running for president in 2016. But after Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the third most popular candidate was a little surprising: It turns out, 7.47 percent of Muslims support Donald Trump.
</p><p>Trump, if you haven't been following the election, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/08/trump-calls-for-complete-shutdown-on-muslims-entering-us.html" target="_blank">has called for</a> a "shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," and is in favor of surveillance techniques <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/" target="_blank">that target people</a> based on their religion, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/21/politics/trump-muslims-surveillance/" target="_blank">if that religion is Islam</a>. It's safe to say the real estate tycoon and TV personality has adopted a posture toward Islam that speaks to the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-muslims-eclusive-idUSKBN0TO00320151205" target="_blank">14.6 percent of Americans</a> who are "generally fearful" of Muslims. But even fellow conservatives have <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBoot/status/668447756512456705" target="_blank">called Trump "a fascist</a>" for his comments about American Muslims.
</p><p>So if you're Muslim, what's the appeal of voting for the guy?
</p><p>"He is anti-establishment, and he comes from the outside. I think one could – from the outside – bring a new perspective to things, and really shake things up in Washington," said Saba Ahmed, president and founder of the Republican Muslim Coalition, who famously wore an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIUy4ioOH9Y" target="_blank">American Flag headscarf</a> while being interviewed by Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly last fall.
</p><p>Ahmed believes a greater Muslim presence in the GOP would help quash growing Islamophobia, both within the party and in the United States at large. "The rise of anti-Islamic sentiment is partially due to the voice of Muslim Americans being missing in the Republican Party," she told me.
</p><p>Republican Muslims are yet another in a long line of counterintuitive political blocs in the US, like, for instance, the pro-Israeli Muslim group called the <a href="http://aifdemocracy.org/about/staff/founder-president/" target="_blank">American Islamic Forum for Democracy</a>, or <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-republicans-gays-idUSN0142354820071102" target="_blank">the Log Cabin Republicans</a>, the best-known organisation representing gay conservatives in the US. But the idea of Muslims putting their support behind someone as outspoken as Trump is about trashing Muslims seems exceptionally strange – and Ahmed acknowledges that.
</p><p>"We are very alarmed by his anti-Islamic rhetoric, and hope to see that change as the campaign goes on," she told me. "But from an economic standpoint, and  his business skills, we would love to see him as our Republican nominee."
</p><p>"He's worked with Muslims all his life, he has properties all over the Middle East, and he has significant business dealings in the Islamic world," she added.<br>
</p><p>It's not just Ahmed. A Facebook group called "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/muslimsfordonaldtrump" target="_blank">Muslims for Trump</a>" exists, and while it rarely gets updated, its anonymous creator published a long, wordy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/muslimsfordonaldtrump/posts/1712877268935443" target="_blank">manifesto</a> earlier this week. It's a little light on details about Trump's policy proposals, but the author does claim not to have heard "a single remark of hatred made by Mr. Trump. No one who has come forth has managed to provide a single example."
</p><p>As for why Trump makes a good candidate, the post is as vague as it is verbose: "We must continue to voice our support, qua Muslims, for an America with a history and an identity, an America who celebrates her Christian heritage loudly and proudly," is the closest the writer gets to an explanation.
</p><p>The Facebook page attracts sympathetic Muslims – though not necessarily ardent Trump supporters. "I find Trump's 'no need to always be politically correct' stance refreshing. I also like his apparent 'telling like it is' demeanor," Nash Khatri, an electrical engineer who has commented on the page, told me in a Facebook message. "I also think he is no dummy, and who knows? He may make a good president."
</p><p>Other Muslim Republicans aren't so sure about Trump. "I do think he has an ability to put his finger on a pulse regarding what the issues are for Americans and on how social media driven marketing works nowadays," said Sarah Cochran, a representative of the Muslim civic group Emerge USA. However, she added, "I wouldn't vote for him."
</p><p>Ahmed also had some criticism of her preferred candidate. "I think he has been hurt in the polls by having a very arrogant attitude," she told me, adding that she thinks Trump needs to "humble down." But while she'd like Trump to change, she said she would still pull the lever for him in November should he become the Republican Party's Islamophobic presidential nominee.
</p><p>"We believe that Islamic values are in line with the Republican party, and there's no way for us to go back to Democrats, or independents for that matter," she said.

<title>Gilmore Girls Deserves To Be Remembered as More Than Just Feelgood Fluff</title>

<description><![CDATA[The family saga is returning to Netflix for a seventh season. Hopefully now it will be remembered as more than just a source of Rory reaction GIFs.
]]></description>
<enclosure url="http://vice-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2016/02/08/gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-1454937230.jpg" type="image/jpg" length="2000"></enclosure>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-body-image-1454934813-size_1000.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="2000" data-original-height="1000" data-model-id="143441" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-body-image-1454934813.jpg" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>Last week, Netflix confirmed that is bringing back Gilmore Girls for a seventh season. And lo, the internet, which is always calling for things to come back or be reunited because it has a real issue with time's linear progression, was finally satiated. Once-respectable news outlets were ablaze with excitement and the weekly <em>Gilmore Girls </em>podcast the <em>Gilmore Guys</em> went beserk. In the last week alone, there have been 10 Buzzfeed articles about Gilmore Girls, including "<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/brittneygibson/this-gilmore-girls-quiz-will-determine-how-muc" target="_blank">This 4 Question Gilmore Girls Quiz Will Determine What Kind Of Coffee Drinker You Are</a>" and "<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/caseyrackham/paris-geller-equals-comedy">18 Times Paris Geller Proved She's The Funniest</a>".
</p><p>For whatever reason, Gilmore Girls has become the ultimate fodder for listicles and reaction GIFs. But like<em> Friends, Frasier, The OC, Mean Girls,</em> any Pixar film and the literal ground that Beyoncé walks on, it has light and shade, progressive moments and some very problematic parts. Sadly this has all been subsumed into a Yassss Queen recall-a-thon where everything becomes one-liners and eye-rolls.
</p><p>But unlike the other shows that have been collapsed under the internet's thirst for nostalgia, Gilmore Girls remains worth rewatching. It shows women in a way that they've never really been seen before on TV, with a quickfire pop culture conversation style that is normally the reserve of the nerdy characters in a teen movie. Lorelai and her daughter Rory, the two Gilmores, reference David Bowie, Sonic Youth and joke about the Menendez brothers.  They talk faster than Six in <em>Blossom</em> (the scripts were so dialogue-heavy they were about 15 pages longer than the average network TV script) and confront class, politics and feminism in a way that still feels fresh by the standards of modern network TV.
</p><p>A lot of the Gilmore cheerleading ignores all this. For example, in none of the cheery Rory-is-my-sidebitch online palaver is there anything about Emily Gilmore, Rory's grandma, who seems to register no facial expression other than mild distaste. You could show her <em>2 Girls 1 Cup</em>and she'd probably just raise an eyebrow and say, "Well that cup looks rather cheap."
</p><p class="has-image"><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-body-image-1454935791.png?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="640" data-original-height="360" data-model-id="143462" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-body-image-1454935791.png" class="vmp-image">
</p><p>When we're first introduced to Emily, she's a Republican monster, a demon of the DAR, who hires and fires maids on the turn of a salad leaf, ridicules her daughter for her haircuts and liberal life choices, and uses money as an emotional weapon.</p><p>A lot of the genius of the show comes because Lorelai Gilmore, Emily's daughter, thinks her mother is a stuck-in-the-mud old grump while she is a bastion of liberal parenting and JC Penney leather jackets. But we, the audience, can see the pair are exactly the same.
</p><p>Lorelai has picked a life that is as small and confined as her mother's. She's lived in the same town since she was 16, worked the same job, had the same friends. She thinks she broke away from the stuffiness of her parents by moving out of their fancy home and into the picture-perfect fantasy land of Stars Hollow, which is actually just as insular, prissy and incestuous as the upper-class world Emily inhabits. Emily's biggest flaw is that she expects her daughter to be exactly like her, but Lorelai gave her daughter her own fucking name and demands she spend every waking minute hanging out with her, so what do you expect.</p><p class="has-image">Lorelai is a flawed anti-hero from a time before flawed anti-heros on TV were cool. She's the perennial teenager, a Petra Pan who has never grown up and wants to be her daughter's best friend. She does dumb things when it comes to men, shies away from honest discussion of problems, and also wears terrible hats - which somehow doesn't have any impact on her love life, but did seem to heavily influence the band Haim.  There's a bite to Lorelai - you wouldn't want to cross her - and she has a core of steel. You fall in love with her not because she's super cool, but because when she fucks up, her loneliness and misery is brutally palpable as she tries to hold it all together.<br><br><img src="https://vice-images.vice.com/images/content-images/2016/02/08/gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-body-image-1454936579.jpg?resize=*:*&output-quality=" data-original-width="618" data-original-height="412" data-model-id="143481" data-path="images/content-images/2016/02/08/" data-crop-path="images/content-images-crops/2016/02/08/" data-image-filename="gilmore-girls-back-netflix-653-body-image-1454936579.jpg" class="vmp-image"></p><p>Rory, meanwhile, is a walking parable of class and inheritance in modern America.  Having a extra generation between her and Emily means she can see her grandmother's greatness, and she's more willing to embrace her posh heritage.  The boyfriend she seems most comfortable with is Logan Huntzburger, who comes from an equally well-established family.  She picks Yale over Harvard, with no qualms about the family connection (her grandfather is an alumnus) - indeed, that's part of the appeal.  But she also loves the movies she watches with her mother, she's laidback and warm, and never leans into the money at her disposal. But in the end, she finds the pull of her background becomes inescapable, and she finishes the show with the life her grandmother would have wanted for Lorelai.</p><p>Like any show from over three years ago, there's a lot about <em>Gilmore Girls</em> that seems politically out-of-step, and it's even more pointed on a show where the main characters are proud liberals who watch <em>The Daily Show</em> every night.
</p><p>There's the junk food.  It's a common TV trope that a woman's relationship to food is an indicator of her personality.  While an uptight character will be pedantic and fussy over meals, chowing down burgers six days a week and only using your oven to store shoes or warm your jeans means a woman is cool, funny and easy going.  It's lazy writing and it's also pretty batshit when you consider the message it sends – the ideal woman is one who eats crap all the time yet is still skinny. Which means when that Emily Gilmore asks always-up-for-a- Chinese-takeaway-and-let's-also-get-a-pizza-for-dessert Queen Rory if she's bulimic, I lean in extra close to the TV to see her reaction.  But they skip over it like it's just another snappy gag that doesn't really matter to the story.</p><p>Gilmore Girls is  also horrendously white. I mean, there is Michel, basically a snotty French cartoon cat who is obsessed with Celine Dion, and Lane, Rory's best friend, may be one of the best teenage girls ever, but her mother Mrs. Kim is a highly devout Korean Seven Day Adventist whose two dimensions consist of hardcore antiquery and a brutal hatred of her daughter's freedom. Oh, and she's all about the tofu. It doesn't seem like creator Amy Sherman-Palladino was into complex and sympathetic representations of different nationalities and cultures.</p><p>To be fair, all the shows from this era -<em> The OC, Dawson's Creek, Gossip Girl</em> - are littered with white privilege and dodgy characters. The best evidence I have that this is a show that deserves far more respect than any other glossy sunshine teen drama offering of the 2000s is the episode when all three <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, and Emily's husband Richard (played by  the indubitably marvellous Edward Herman) finally make their peace with each other.  The last five minutes of "Friday Night's Alright For Fighting" consist of a scene that smoothly wends its way between the family crying, screaming at each other, laughing hysterically, appreciating the delectable dinner, and finally collapsing with exhaustion.  It's the most perfect representation of real family life that I've ever seen.
</p><p>I can't believe this show only ever won an Emmy for makeup.

</p><p>Jesus Christ, imagine actually winning the Lottery? We all have our fantasy Amazon baskets filled with plush 4K TVs and a solid gold swingball set, but only the good Lord knows what we'd actually do when faced with such a befuddling amount of money. Charity? Cokey cruise? Get some people you don't like taken out? Would it turn you into a madman, hellbent on genetically modifying stem cells into an eternal caviar production line? We can dream.
</p><p>For those of us lucky enough to have a bizarre amount of cash bestowed on us by the sky deities (via a pink numbered slip given to a shop vendor along with a four pack of Stella, a bag of sweet chilli Sensations and a Star Bar), certain protocols need to be adhered to. You don't just get the whole lot plonked in your account. Camelot, the governing body for the National Lottery, has a team of what they call 'Winners Advisors'. These people help newfound mill-yun-airs not go completely spare and drop it all on a lifetime supply of Bentleys in a fit of adrenaline-fuelled madness. They also make sure their recently sugared children don't get exploited.
</p><p>We spoke to the Senior Winners Advisor at Camelot, Andy Carter, to find out what really happens when you win big.
</p><p><strong>VICE: Hi Andy. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do?</strong><br><strong>Andy Carter:</strong> I'm Camelot's Senior Winners Advisor, so I lead a team of five people, and we're based around the UK. When someone wins more than £50,000 on the Lottery, we go out to their home to pay them their prizes and look after them.
</p><p><strong>How are you notified of the win, and do you all bundle into an A-Team-style van and head up to where they are? <br></strong>When people win, they ring the number on the back of their ticket to make their claim. We then get passed their details, give them a call back and tell them what will happen. We go and see them and sort the paperwork out, but there's more to it than that. It's about looking after people at a life-changing moment, a moment nobody ever forgets. We make sure they have access to legal advice, financial advice, we talk to them about media interest, we talk to them about what other people have done. It's about giving them a bit of support.
</p><p><strong>Is there any specific skill set you need to be a Winners Advisor?<br></strong>You need good listening skills, you need good empathy, and I think you need to be quite happy and upbeat as well. You need to be able to judge people's moods because everyone reacts differently. You need to be able to jump up and down when people are jumping up and down, but equally you have to understand when people are feeling nervous and being quiet, and you have to reflect that.
</p><p><strong>What do you personally do in the team?<br></strong>We're all Winners Advisors, I just happen to manage them. We're based around the UK. I'm in Cardiff, but winners are never spread out evenly – it's a lottery, so we could end up anywhere. We go and see them, pay them the money, and have follow-up meetings with lawyers. We see about a thousand people a year who win more than £50,000, so it's quite a lot.
</p><p><strong>What kind of protection and help do you offer to these newfound millionaires?<br></strong>They need to have access to high quality legal advice, namely legal that's used to dealing with large amounts of money. So if you were to win, say, over a million pounds, we'd be saying to you: 'First of all, we recommend it doesn't go into a normal high street bank account.' We have contacts with all the major banks. Some of them have departments that just deal with lottery winners. We get one of those representatives to come out while we're with the winner, and they open up a separate account that's shielded from the branch network. So if you were to walk into a branch of your particular bank, they would never know that you have this money. It's about ensuring the funds go over there discreetly, and swiftly, and make sure the winners have access to advice.
</p><p>Perhaps people have to consider things like inheritance tax, which they haven't had to think about before. People think, 'I want to put money aside for my children when I'm older but I want to make sure they spend it wisely,' you know? The classic one is always, 'I want to put money aside for my daughter but when she turns 20, how do I know there's not a lad hanging around who isn't... you know!' People worry about what happens if one of them dies so make sure they have things like wills in place, because their estate is big now, and needs managing. We have meetings with lawyers and financial advisors. Now, they don't have the winners' contact details at this  point, so they're not able to contact the winners afterwards. If the winner wants to contact the experts, that's down to them. It's all about making sure the winner has a bit of time, and a bit of space.
</p><p><strong>Where does the relationship with the winner come to an end?<br></strong>That's a real challenge for us. You need to know when to withdraw. Some people just want to be paid the money and move on very quickly and that's absolutely fine. Others, particularly the publicity ones, will stay in contact with you for much longer because you're entering their lives at a unique time. Only for a short period, but still. For us it's about ensuring we maintain the ratio the winner wants. There's no hard and fast rule on that one.
</p><p><strong>Whats the worst reaction you've have had to a win?<br></strong>You get a multitude of reactions. You get people jumping up and down, you get people who are very quiet, you get people who are in denial and disbelief and perhaps don't even want to believe they've won because it's a shock. They want to carry on with the day they would normally have had, and we've got to respect that.
</p><p><strong>What's the largest amount of money you've had to help someone with? What did they do with it?<br></strong>The biggest winners in the UK that I dealt with were Colin and Christine Weir from Largs in Scotland, and they won £161million. To be honest with you, they reacted the same as any other major winners react. The disbelief, the shock. There's happiness – their brain will be going a thousand miles an hour to deal with the news. They set up a huge charitable trust (the Weir Charitable Trust) and have been very wise. They invested money back into their community, charitable causes, things like that. Running a charity is a full-time occupation too. They employ people and they've been able to do a lot of good with their money.
</p><p><strong>Do you think people have a responsibility to give part of their winnings to charity?<br></strong>I think it's down to the individual. What you find is, a lot of winners gift money anyway, to family and friends. You have to remember if you've won a million pounds, there's a difference between that and winning £61million, regarding what you can do. You know, a million pounds means you can set yourself up, you might be able to set your children up a bit. And that's wonderful. Loads do make charitable donations and lots do set up charitable trusts. I'm not sure they have a responsibility. They have a responsibility to use the money wisely.
</p><p><strong>Does meeting millionaires all the time make you a bit jealous?<br></strong>No! First of all I'm not allowed to play, so I know I can't win. That makes it easier. But it's great. You're meeting these people who won money through good fortune, so there's nothing not to like about that really, is there? And they let you into their life for a little bit of time. You get to know them. If you won a million pounds on the lottery, you'd think it's fantastic, wouldn't you?
</p><p><strong>What do you do when you're not travelling the country greeting winners?<br></strong>Well to be honest, it's a full-time job. There's a lot of traveling, a lot of media stuff. A couple of weeks after we first see a winner, we have a follow-up meeting with a lawyer and financial advisor. There are  draws on Friday and Saturday night, and scratchcards come into it too. Six millionaires every week are made across the UK so there's an awful lot of work to do.
</p><p><strong>Finally Andy, how on earth did you get into this line of work?<br></strong>I just saw the job advertised! I think you've got to have a passion for it, you've got to love it, and you've got to make sure you see the winners as human beings. You need the human touch, you need to look after people. I think that's what matters. You need to take the time and identify what people want.
</p><p><strong>Lovely, hopefully I'll see you soon.</strong>

</p><p class="photo-credit">Some cells in Alcatraz. Cells in British prisons will soon be known as "the office" (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alcatraz_Island_-_prison_cells.jpg" target="_blank">Photo by marine_perez</a>)
</p><p><em>Names and identifying details have been changed to protect privacy.</em><br></p><p>On Monday, David Cameron set out
reforms to a prison system that he says currently "shames us all" because
there's so much violence, drug-taking and self-harm. He said: "I strongly
believe that we must offer chances to change; that for those trying hard to
turn themselves around, we should offer hope... In short: we need a prison system that doesn't see prisoners
as simply liabilities to be managed, but instead as potential assets to be
harnessed."
</p><p class="MsoNormal">It sounds hopey-changey, but what will treating people
as "assets" really mean? Back in October, Michael Gove spelled it out. A specific
focus is being placed on education in prisons, which is all about fostering
entrepreneurial spirit. Gove told the 
	<i>Telegraph</i>:
"We should definitely have more business going into prison. You could have
businesses running in prisons." He cites the use of call centres operating out
of prisons in the US, and also the admirable work that key-cutting and shoe
repair firm Timpson does in the UK to integrate ex-offenders into its staff.
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal"> 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">I <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/teaching-in-prison-554" target="_blank">teach in prison</a> so I
have a pretty good idea of the extent of the business acumen among those who
are locked up. I teach burglars, ram-raiders, the occasional fraudster – but
they all tend to be acting out of desperation, usually linked directly to
either drug dependency or impending home eviction. The most obvious
entrepreneurs are the drug dealers. Committed subscribers to the free market
and capitalist doctrine, these guys are surely who Gove is aiming to empower:
but would any of them be willing to swap Maybach money for minimum wage and
timed toilet breaks? I asked some what they think of the reforms.
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal"> 
</p><p class="MsoNormal">33-year-old
Ryan is a former professional athlete sentenced to ten years for dealing coke.
It's his first conviction, but the scale of his operation and its relatively
high profile nature meant a stiff sentence. He explains to me that he was
working on a plan before getting busted that would have seen him open a
holistic health and organic supplement store in his local area and then expand
into different areas over time. I ask him if he is
aware of the possible contradiction of going from supplying his community with
coke to wheatgrass and raw cacao powder. He blushes a little, offering "Mate!"
as his only response. 
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ryan is at the higher end of the scale academically in terms of the
prisoners I teach; although he has pretty limited qualifications, he is bright
enough to be gaining merits and distinctions in the FE college business course
he is studying. He's also smart enough to realise that I will have Googled him,
and asks what I made of the national press coverage he received. I ask him
whether he regrets being so openly flash with his money. Ryan tells me that if
he knew what he knows now about business models and growth, he would have
reduced his presence in the market to stay off the police radar. He frames this
approach around Patagonia, the outdoor and adventure clothing firm, who last
year stated it would seek to shrink the business as part of a long-term
stability strategy. 
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ryan will be transferred to an open prison soon and will then probably
be released in the next 18 months. On release he plans to set up his business;
a combination of legit money he earned from his career in sports and a small
loan from his father in law will be enough to cover the first year's setup and
operating costs. I ask if he would consider employing an ex-offender. "You mad,
bro?" he says as he photocopies carefully selected pages from a Richard Branson
biography that's due back at the library tomorrow.
	
</p><p class="pullquote">If I'm going to be bored and depressed, I might as well be earning £5,000 a week doing it<br>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">It's a cliché, but most drug dealers are good with mental arithmetic,
and 25-year-old Alex is no different. Alex pleaded guilty to a Class A supply
at the earliest opportunity, knowing that as this was his second conviction for
drugs he'd be in line for something heftier if he went to trial and lost. The
judge was impressed with his contrition but warned him that a third conviction
in the future would have pretty bleak consequences. His partner has told him
that she wants a baby but won't consider it unless he gives up dealing. He has
a scar that begins near the top of his forehead and runs deep into his
hairline. Alex talks about the trap houses he ran and says it was easy money
but ultimately boring and depressing. I ask him to expand and he tells
me I don't want to know. 
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal">I ask what he wants to do instead of dealing. Would he consider getting
a job cutting keys and engraving cat names on small copper discs at Timpson,
for example? "If I'm going to be bored and depressed, I might as well be
earning five  a week doing it," he says.

</iframe><p>Not everyone is on board with Gove's project. Mark Icke, the vice
president of the Prisoner's Governor's Association has voiced concerns that
while education is important, many of the people in the prison system have a
variety of serious issues that need sorting before they can contemplate
applying for small business loans and setting up a LinkedIn.
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal">From my own teaching experience, it seems like a valid criticism. Arron,
19, is waiting to '"run trial" on a charge of selling heroin, crack and miaow
outside a school. He is adamant that he will "bust case", explaining that he
has sacked his "faggot solicitor" and hired the solicitor his cellmate has used
on over 30 occasions. Arron's work is borderline GCSE standard, and it's a
chore to get him to complete the simplest of tasks. He talks ceaselessly in
monologues often lasting for anything up to ten minutes and usually revolving
around massage parlours, Huaraches, and his dad – an enigmatic "businessman who
lives in America". His lack of empathy is at times astonishing, and there's a
dead-eyed malevolence in an unfinished letter he shows me where he tells an ex
he'll take her back if she gets a tattoo of his name on her stomach. Weirder
still, he tells me he's sent the exact same letter to two other exes. It's
often hard to shut him up, and the other prisoners in the class find him
annoying and full of shit, but maybe working as a call centre operator is just
what he needs to increase his sense of empathy. Or perhaps not.
	
</p><p class="MsoNormal">A cynic might say that running businesses in prisons seems like a pretty
sweet way to engage in modern-day sub-minimum-wage slave labour. But maybe the
scheme deserves the benefit of the doubt. After all, could it actually be
the ultimate deterrent to committing crime in the first place? Get caught
selling rocks and it's five years on outbound calls at seven quid a week.</p><p><strong>More from VICE:</strong>

</p><p>Western yoga practice has been hijacked by skinny young white women with a vague new age philosophy, a raw vegan diet and a set of Instagram filters. It's become so commercialised that you'd no longer be surprised to see a class in London priced at £25 or a pair of designer yoga pants for £400. However, attached to that discussion of privilege and race lingers the related but distinctly different question: is the <em>actual </em>practice of yoga religious or cultural appropriation?
</p><p>This isn't a new concern. See  xojane's op-ed "<a href="http://www.xojane.com/issues/yoga-religious-cultural-appropriation">Like It Or Not, Western Yoga Is A Textbook Example Of Cultural Appropriation</a>", or a recent VICE <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/a-yoga-class-has-been-canceled-at-a-canadian-university-over-cultural-issues" target="_blank">report</a> on Jennifer Scharf, a yoga practitioner who had her free weekly sessions to students at the University of Ottawa cancelled being culturally appropriative. According to the student union, yoga had been "under a lot of controversy lately due to how it is being practised" and that it was often sacred and spiritual practices that were taken from cultures which "have experienced oppression, cultural genocide and diasporas due to colonialism and Western supremacy". <br><br><a href="http://www.hafsite.org/media/pr/takeyogaback">Take Yoga Back</a> is a campaign run by the Hindu American Society. It was set up in 2003 in a response to the proliferation of new forms of yoga to protect the underlying meaning, philosophy, and purpose of yoga from Western dilution. As Sri Pattabhi Jois, a famous Indian yoga teacher who developed Ashtanga yoga, once said: Westerners "practice yoga primarily for their health, which is okay. But to really understand the heritage of India, one must also understand its ancient tradition. Some Westerners overlook this great heritage and have no idea what are the roots of yoga."
</p><p>Certainly, this accusation rings true for 99 percent of IG yogi warriors posting photos of them in crow while eating their chia seed pudding. So we got in touch with some yoga scholars to find out how yoga became a thing in the West, and what you need to know to be able to practise it without being a dick.
</p><h2>Modern Yoga Is a Response to Colonial Stereotypes</h2><p>"Before colonisation, yoga was mainly a spiritual practice, bar beggars and contortionists who worked the urban streets for cash. But around the 20th century, it was used as a way for young men to bulk," says James Mallinson, lecturer in Sanskrit and Classical Indian Studies at SOAS. "There was this idea propagated by the British that Indians were lazy and weak," he adds. Reappropriating hatha yoga became a larger project of Indian nation building and the construction of a "new Indian man". This meant a blended yoga with martial arts of various sorts.
</p><h2>Yoga Borrowed from Western Physical Culture, Too</h2><p>At the same time as Indian men were bulking up, parts of Western culture – like Ling gymnastics and drilling, which was very popular in Europe at the time – were making an impact on traditional yoga, too."India actually included some aspects of western 'physical culture' into their yoga practice," says James. "Cultural appropriation suggests there are pure essences, but the borrowing here kind of cut both ways." Professor Waltraud Ernst, an Indian history expert at Oxford Brookes university, says that even now modern Western new age yoga practices are being "re-imported into India for westernised Indian elite groups".
</p><h2>There's No Such Thing as 'Authentic' Yoga</h2><p>So much cultural cross-pollination has happened as yoga has developed that it is impossible to pin down its true origins. "Postural yoga has such a twisted history going back to the 9th or 10th century that there is really nothing that can be said to be 'authentic'," explains Joseph Alter Stewart, Professor of Social Sciences at Yale. "At one point in time it was alchemy, then a martial art, then a form of spiritual exercise, then physical fitness, then self-development, then medicine. And all of this before it was brought to the West." The poses we do in yoga now – downward dog and sun salutations – have barely been around for 100 years. "There is no 'pure' yoga that you can identify as having been around for long," he says.
</p><h2>Indian Teachers Wanted to Bring Yoga to the West</h2><p>Another point to remember in this loose, confused timeline is that Indian yogis actively promoted their practice in the West. Swami Vivekananda was one of these people, adapting traditional Hindu ideas to suit the needs and understandings of Western audiences, who were especially interested in movements like transcendentalism and new age thought. He travelled around Europe and America sharing his ideas and in 1896 he  published the book <em>Raja Yoga</em>, which was central to the West's idea of yoga. "He liked to have himself depicted in oriental dress when he was in the West, and in modern, Western dress in the East," says Professor Ernst. "So, some of the main protagonists in sharing yoga with the West were very aware of how to market themselves to Western consumers."
</p><p>Professor Mallinson says the yogis "knew exactly what they were doing: they were tailoring their practice for an audience that included Westerners and made it more palatable for them. In fact that's a duplication of the history of yoga. For centuries it has always been adapting to the context where it finds itself. To claim that the West has nicked yoga betrays someone who a political agenda. They are actually denying agency to the Indians who were responsible for spreading yoga."
</p><h2>New Yoga Fads Trivialise Spirituality </h2><p>Understandably, many people, such as the Hindu American Society, have anxiety surrounding their spiritual positioning in the world being associated with something as frivolous and commercialised as what white western yoga has become. Light trends like voga and naked yoga, which are hurtling through gym timetables quicker than it takes to blend a green juice, belittle colonial history. Ironically, taking yoga's convoluted past into consideration, one big problem is the idea that there's some kind of unbroken tradition of yoga that gives it a sense of religious authority. Westerners want to feel like they're doing something traditional. They sort of are, but they're also not. And understanding that paradox is the crux of practising something so entwined with religion with the respect it deserves.<br><br>
