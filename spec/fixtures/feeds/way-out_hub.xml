The idea of sprints originates with the Agile framework. The idea of design thinking was developed at IDEO and the d.school at Stanford. These frameworks were adapted to the idea of “design sprints” thanks to the Google UX teams, Google Ventures and Google [x] and teams across the industry.<br />While sprints are popular at Google, they are also used by startups and companies of any size.</p><p>I really enjoyed how Google rationalised some common UX best practices making them easy to adapt to teams who are just beginning their design practice.</p>

<p>Nusa Dua, located in the south-est area of the island, is probably the most tourist area of the island. The main difference between Seminyak, another tourist-only location, is that Nusa Dua is mainly an enclave of luxury resorts. Spending three days here means rejuvenating. I wouldn't do anything besides relaxing at a day Spa (such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g297698-d3219099-Reviews-Jari_Menari_Nusa_Dua-Nusa_Dua_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html)">Jari Menari</a>)&nbsp;and possibly going snorkelling.</p><h3>Manta Ray bay</h3>

But if the weather conditions are great, be sure to take back home some outstanding photos.</p><p> </p><h3>Batik, wood carving and Kopi Luwak coffee</h3>

<p>I'm sure you crave to find some souvenirs to take back home. Ask your driver to head up to a Batik shop. The word batik originates from the Javanese tik and means to dot. To make a batik, selected areas of the cloth are blocked out by brushing or drawing hot wax over them, and the cloth is then dyed.&nbsp;</p><p>Right after that you may decide to visit a wood carving center and gaze upon the wonderful art of carving wood sculptures.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, you can't miss a visit to a coffea plantation.</p><p>Sip on a wide variaty of teas and try the Kopi Luwak Coffea. Kopi luwak, or civet coffee, refers to the coffee that includes part-digested coffee cherries eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet. Sounds disgusting, but it's not that bad after all.</p><p> </p><h2>Day Four:</h2><h3>Tegallalang Rice terraces</h3><p>Tegallalang Rice Terraces in Ubud is famous for its beautiful scenes of rice paddies involving the subak (traditional Balinese cooperative irrigation system), which according to history, was passed down by a revered holy man named Rsi Markandeya in the eighth century. Tegallalang forms the three most splendid terraced landscapes in Ubud's shared region, with the others being in the villages of Pejeng and Campuhan.</p>

<p>Tegallang alone has an outlook that spreads down before you and away to the rice terraces on the slopes across the valley. The high roadside location is cool and breezy and it is a well-known spot for tourists to stop and take photos. Painters and nature lovers also enjoy visiting this spot, and there are numerous art kiosks and cafes near the ledge offering their ware.</p><p>(Source <a href="http://www.bali-indonesia.com/">http://www.bali-indonesia.com</a>)</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: &nbsp;North of Ubud - Tegallalang is half an hour's drive north of Ubud. From the main Ubud art market, head east to the large statue intersection and head further up north.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Gunun Kawi</h3><p>Located about a mile south of Tampaksiring, Bali's "Valley of the Kings" is located in a ravine between ricefields. The Pakerisan river flows through this ravine, and the cliffs flanking the river feature shrines carved into the stone honoring kings and queens from the 11th century. The Balinese - big believers in the holiness of water - believe that the river sanctifies Pura Gunung Kawi.</p>

<p> </p><h3>Tirta Empul</h3><p>The sacred spring that feeds Tirta Empul provides holy water for priests and bathing for ordinary Balinese, who believe that a dip hereabouts can bring good fortune and health. An offering must first be made at the temple before you can climb into the long main pool to bathe and meditate.</p>

Props, screws, wires, carbon fiber frames, motors have been all over my 
desk for months, and I still have no idea of what I'm doing...

Every-time I start a new hobby I usually end up focusing 100% of my spare 
time on figuring out how to max up my skills and my knowledge on the 
matter. 

This time, my new hobby has made me insane.


There are hundreds of drone models, kits, brands on the 
market. Quadcopters, FPV Racers, Hexacopters, Octocopters.Where to start? 
What to buy?

After many weeks of trial and error, I thought that sharing my experience 
would have helped many Wannabe Drone Pilots.

<p>I've started a terrible new Hobby: <strong>Drones</strong>.</p><p>Props, screws, wires, carbon fiber frames, motors have been all over my desk for months, and I still have no idea of what I'm doing...</p><p>But the idea of mixing all three of my passions, <strong>travel, photography and technology</strong> keeps me motivated in pursuing the frustrating and time consuming activity.</p><p>Every-time I start a new hobby I usually end up focusing 100% of my spare time on figuring out how to max up my skills and my knowledge on the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, my new hobby has made me insane.<br /><br />There are hundreds of drone models, kits, brands on the market.&nbsp;Quadcopters, FPV Racers, Hexacopters, Octocopters. Where to start? What to buy?</p><p>After many weeks of trial and error, I thought that sharing my experience would have helped many Wannabe Drone Pilots.</p><p>Here's an overview on the first models to buy and how to gradually evolve this terrible yet fascinating hobby. Prepare your credit card.</p><h2> </h2><h2><strong>Aviation Academy - Learn the basics</strong></h2><p>Probably you're trying to figure out what will be your first drone. You're browsing amazon, forums, and tech blogs to find the best drone you can buy with your budget.</p><p>Probably you're looking at the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dji.com/product/phantom"> DJI Phantom 3</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dji.com/product/inspire-1">DJI Inspire</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="http://3drobotics.com">3DRobotics Solo</a>.</p><p>But are you ready to crash more than 1000€ worth of equipment?</p><p>My suggestion is that first of all you understand the basics of flying.</p><p>Buy a cheap small Drone, maybe a<strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B009M1PO7W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=B009M1PO7W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=waou-21">Hubsan</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B009M1PO7W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=B009M1PO7W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=waou-21"> H107L X4 Mini Drone</a></strong>. Worth only 50€. Fly it in you house, learn the basics, break it, fix it. Understand if you're really interested in this hobby. If so you're ready for the runway.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Hangar - Build your first drone</strong></h2><p>Before preparing for takeoff I strongly recommend you to learn how to build a drone. Building is half the fun, and will teach you how to fix your next drone in case of crashing it.</p><p>There are many Drone kits out there. My suggestion is to build an FPV 250 Racing Drone.</p><h3><strong>What is an FPV 250 Racing Drone?</strong></h3><p>What is the difference between a mini drone and some of the other popular platforms such as the Iris+ or the Phantom?</p><p>Drones like Phantoms and the like are easy to fly. They are built with multiple safety features and everyone can easily get started with them. However learning the basics with Mini Quadcopters that are built for speed will entangle you to this hobby.</p><p>To better understand what I'm talking about I suggest you to view the following two videos:</p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H19z1X3V4UQ?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">

This 
edition is fully dedicated to the themes of food and sustainability. 

Its first days have been a great success among the public, with an influx 
of roughly 200,000 visitors each day. 
Working for Accenture, Official Partner, I had the opportunity to work on 
the Official APP. This instilled in me an even greater expectation and 
curiosity for day one. 

My high expectations were not let down. Since from the opening I could 
experience the spectacular pavilions. 

No pavilion should be missed out, and remember that exposition will go on 
until 31 October, however if you have only one day to spend in the venue I 
created a list of Must-See Pavilions.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>"Utsuwa" is the term to describe the traditional Japanese ceramics that are characterized by many different styles, and likewise, its pavilion symbolizes the wealth and the multiplicity of Japan’s culture. Representing the fusion between tradition and modernity, environmental and aesthetic perfection, Japan proposes a pavilion that spreads over an exhibition area of ,170 square meters, with a wide entrance and lengthwise orientation, like one of the traditional houses of Kyoto. In addition to the use of natural materials such as bamboo and wood, it makes use of technologies and systems for energy conservation. Furthermore, a range of events and installations stimulate the five senses, allowing visitors to fully experience Japan’s food culture.</p><p><strong>Reason to visit? </strong>Embrace a mind blowing experience.<br /> </p><h2><br />Morocco</h2>

<p>The UAE Pavilion explores the very real challenges that arise in feeding the planet, particularly in the interwoven topics of land, food, energy and water. It also highlights some of the innovative solutions that the UAE has developed in these areas. Solutions have been arrived at based on a local need but they have a very real global benefit since many parts of the world will be experiencing the same difficulties as the Emirates due to spiralling demand and the effects of climate change. By sharing knowledge and resources, the UAE is truly helping to shape the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azerbaijan is strategically located in Caucasia between the North, South, East and West, and is one of Mankind’s oldest cultural sites, a crossroads for history, culture, biology, nature and ecology.<br />The awareness of its strategic location, cultural bridge between North and South, East and West, has inspired policies to protect the territory of this country, rich in natural, human and cultural resources.<br />&nbsp;<br />Its individual interpretation of the theme of Expo Milano 2015: Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life is centered on thematic itineraries that aim to educate visitors on Azerbaijan as a great producer and exporter of organic, genuine and healthy products. It also seeks to promote the great historical and cultural traditions in the food industry and to introduce a new political vision focus on sustainable development, biodiversity and health for future generations.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Reason to visit:</strong> Walk in three different biospheres.</p><p> </p><h2>Switzerland</h2><p>With its unique take on the theme of Expo Milano 2015 Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life, Switzerland, which was the first country to join the Expo Milano 2015, reflects on the scarcity of food resources in the world and shows the other side of abundance. Its pavilion is made up of four towers, full of local food products which the visitor can take away. But there is a limit to the resources available... to exceed that limit is to deprive other visitors of the same opportunities.<br />Thanks to the modularity of the structure, the platform on which the towers stand is lowered as they are emptied, allowing everyone to see for themselves their own habits of consumption.

<p>The UK Pavilion follows the journey of the honey bee to highlight the role of pollination in the global food chain and ecosystem. This complex environment encapsulates some of the qualities the UK brings to the global food challenge. It offers a metaphor for describing how the exchange of ideas, skills and knowledge is an essential part of human activity and the UK, as a gateway of global connections, is the ideal place for such cross-pollination to happen.<br />Visitors will take part in an immersive experience through a British orchard and wildflower meadow with typical native plant species, moving onto a 17 metre high stylised bee hive in the form of an aluminium sphere. The hive is made up of over 180,000 components and weighs 30 tonnes. Visitors will be surrounded by sounds and lights flickering in response to movements within a real bee hive based in the UK.</p><p><strong>Reason to visit: </strong>Walk in the hive of innovation and creativity helping to feed the planet.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Italian Pavilion</h2>

But what if you could engineer a reverse state of being? What if you could make a device that you wouldn’t—couldn’t—use for hours at a time? What if you could create a device that could filter out all the bullshit and instead only serve you truly important information? You could change modern life. And so after three-plus decades of building devices that grab and hold our attention—the longer the better—Apple has decided that the way forward is to fight back.&nbsp;Apple, in large part, created our problem. And it thinks it can fix it with a square slab of metal and a Milanese loop strap.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.tommasonervegna.com/blog/2015/4/2/the-secret-history-of-the-apple-watch">Permalink</a><p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea/551d4dc0e4b0bd71df7f67c9/1427984071942/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="938"><media:title type="plain">The Secret History of the Apple Watch</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>HooToo Tripmate HT-TM01 Review - A True Digital Swiss Army Knife</title><category>Tools and Gadgets</category><dc:creator>Tommaso Nervegna</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2015 17:03:39 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.tommasonervegna.com/blog/2015/3/30/hootoo-tripmate-ht-tm01-review-a-true-digital-swiss-army-knife</link><guid isPermaLink="false">503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5:503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea:55194eb0e4b05ec98fe7128c</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p>Traveling often I'm always in search of gadgets that can ease my stress.</p><p>One of the first world problems I usually encounter when travelling,&nbsp;is the wi-fi limitations in hotels.&nbsp;Often too slow and most likely don't support more than once connection at a time.&nbsp;Usually the cable connection is an&nbsp;excellent solution for my laptop,&nbsp;but what about my mobile devices?</p><p>Recently,&nbsp;I discovered a&nbsp;device that’s a combination of&nbsp;an external battery pack, Wi-Fi router, and a micro NAS.</p><h2>What is the TripMate?</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00JPUE1LU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=B00JPUE1LU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=waou-21">TripMate</a>&nbsp;is a combination device.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It’s a 6000 mAh&nbsp;battery pack that&nbsp;you can use it to recharge your devices on the go.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s a Wi-Fi router; that you can use &nbsp;both as a LAN-to-Wi-Fi node or a stand alone Wi-Fi node that can be shared with many devices.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s &nbsp;a NAS (Network Attached Storage unit) that&nbsp;you can plug a to a USB drive&nbsp;and share files and stream media.</li></ul><h2>The Design</h2><p>The device&nbsp;is well-designed and built in the shape of a small battery. It weighs only 125g, the same as an iPhone 5. Wide only&nbsp;three fingers, it is light and&nbsp;compact enough to be stored in a backpack or even a pocket. Perfect for trips.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>As a&nbsp;<strong>battery</strong>&nbsp;<strong>pack</strong>, the TripMate functions seamlessly. Even if not over powered as other external battery packs. I was able to charge fully my iPhone 6 and more than 50% of my iPad. I was able to stream content to my iPad for 6 hours straight before dying.</p><p>As a Wi-Fi router I always maxed out the connection speed I was on.</p><p><strong>Wi-Fi coverage</strong>&nbsp;was also outstanding. Considering most people will be using the device in&nbsp;small areas (such as hotel rooms)&nbsp;the signal power is more than enough.</p><p>As a NAS it also performed well. I had no issues moving files between a Hard Drive and my Macbook. And HD&nbsp;<strong>video streaming</strong>&nbsp;is flawless.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>If you need a travel router and a&nbsp;travel NAS, you can't go wrong with the Tripmate. For only 35€ it's a more than respectable device that can drastically improve your trips.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00JPUE1LU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=B00JPUE1LU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=waou-21">HooToo ® Tripmate HT-TM01 Router - 35€ on Amazon</a></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea/55194eb0e4b05ec98fe7128c/1427735108069/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1125"><media:title type="plain">HooToo Tripmate HT-TM01 Review - A True Digital Swiss Army Knife</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>My Backup in the Cloud: Dropbox + Google Drive + Backblaze</title><category>Productivity Tips</category><category>App Reviews</category><dc:creator>Tommaso Nervegna</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 17:31:46 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.tommasonervegna.com/blog/2015/2/23/my-backup-in-the-cloud-dropbox-google-drive-backblaze</link><guid isPermaLink="false">503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5:503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea:54eb6230e4b0328389b25fcd</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p>I'm an anxious guy. I've always been. I unfortunatly live with the fear of forgetting about something, taking precautions before doing anything. I simply need to have everything under control.&nbsp;</p><p>Amongst my many fears, I have always felt the urge to do double, if not even, triple backups of everything for my peace of mind.</p><p>The war for the best Online storage service has recently escalated to a new level. Companies such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2015/02/20/microsoft-100gb-onedrive-storage/">Microsoft have even started offering 100GB </a>for free if you have a Dropbox account.</p><p>The competition is rough and the decision to choose the right cloud storage service is starting to get a bit complicated.</p><p>I don't want to share with you a compare chart based upona my online researches where I point out the differences between the various solutions.</p><p>I will simply describe to you my current online backup setting hoping that it could be somehow inspiring for you.</p><p>My setup relies upon the sinergy between 3 main services: <a target="_blank" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://backblaze.com">Backblaze</a>. Plus of course backing everything up on External Hard Drives.</p><p>But before getting in to details, let me answer a couple of things:</p><h3>Why you should always have more than one Backup</h3><p>You're backup will never be safe unless you have a solid backup strategy that relies on redundancy. I oblige to the&nbsp;backup rule of three, also known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheComputerBackupRuleOfThree.aspx">Backup 3-2-1 rule</a>. What if your house burns down? What if Dropbox screws up for some reason&nbsp;your backup and you instantly loose a decade of pictures?</p><blockquote><strong>3 copies of anything you care about</strong><em>&nbsp;- Two isn't enough if it's important.</em><br /><strong>2 different formats</strong><em>&nbsp;- Example: Dropbox+DVDs or Hard Drive+Memory Stick or, as I do,&nbsp;Hard Drive+Backblaze, or more</em><br /><strong>1 off-site backup</strong><em>&nbsp;- If the house burns down, how will you get your memories back?</em></blockquote><h3>Why use three services?</h3><p>It's because of the budget. I won't lie. It would be much easier to simply stick to <a target="_blank" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>+<a target="_blank" href="http://backblaze.com">Backblaze</a>, however I think that in the present time Dropbox is far to expensive compared to the competion.</p><h3>Why do I still use Dropbox if it's so expensive?</h3><p>Because of it's almost perfect (and fast) camera roll upload functionality and due to the fact that many App I use daily sync trough dropbox. Another main reason why I use Dropbox is the fact that in time I gained up 20GB for free by inviting people to join Dropbox. Very convenient.</p><p>Probably I will switch completly to iCloud Drive as soon as I'm able to fully test the Photos app since it looks really promising and I can sync all of my App settings trough iCloud too.&nbsp;</p><p>I can't deny that I also make use of Flickr for an extra backup solution limited only to photos. I use a <a target="_blank" href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/95380-move-dropbox-photos-from-camera-uploads-folder-to-flickr-gallery">IFTTT recipe to auto-upload My Camera Roll folder from dropbox to Flickr</a>.</p><h3>Why don't you rely only on Google Drive?</h3><p>Because of the file ownership policies.</p><blockquote>"Your Content in our Services: When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide licence to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes that we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.<br />The rights that you grant in this licence are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This licence continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing that you have added to Google Maps)."</blockquote><p>This sentence doesn't clearly define the final scope.</p><p> </p><h2>The Setup</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://dropbox.com"><strong>Dropbox</strong></a>: is mainly used for Camera uploads and syncing App settings, as fore-mentioned, I’m waiting to fully test the Photos App of iCloud Drive when it will be officially released.</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>/<a target="_blank" href="http://creative.adobe.com">Creative Cloud</a></strong>: I use Google Drive to have a shared reference folder and for when I need to collaborate on documents or projects with teams that don’t use or have Creative Cloud(that offer 100GB if you're subscribed).&nbsp;</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://backblaze.com"><strong>Backblaze</strong></a>: After much research, this service is the easiest and most affordable way to backup files to an off-site cloud server. For only 50$ a year it does a complete backup of my hard drive and my external USB disks. No weird settings to play around with, just register, download the app and start syncing all of your hard drive. Is it secure? Yes, the files that are backed up on Backblaze are more secure than the files you have in Dropbox thanks to data encryption.</p><p>If you loose your computer or you need to restore it you can simply reinstall the app and conveniently restore your data in 3 simple ways: downloading a zip file, making the company send you a USB drive or a USB flash drive.</p><p>Backing up files has never been so easy and affordable. I think that memories(and documents) are worth less than 5$ a month. So why not reach the peace of mind and starting setting up your own personal Backup in the cloud?</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea/54eb6230e4b0328389b25fcd/1424849459184/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="448" height="368"><media:title type="plain">My Backup in the Cloud: Dropbox + Google Drive + Backblaze</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Due 2 - Create reminders at the speed of light</title><category>App Reviews</category><dc:creator>Tommaso Nervegna</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2015 18:38:12 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.tommasonervegna.com/blog/2015/2/18/due-2-create-reminders-at-the-speed-of-light</link><guid isPermaLink="false">503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5:503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea:54e486d3e4b02764056c513b</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p>A long flight can be both a curse and a blessing when it comes to getting things done.</p><p>The aircraft cabin noise that simply doesn't stop, with kids two rows ahead that won't go to sleep, the guy sitting next to you smells like he has been on a diet that required him to eat only onions and keeps looking at your monitor asking questions like: What are you working on? You’re a designer? I’m a designer too, I use Power Point. Can you use Power Point on MacBooks too? All of this while the guy sitting in front of you reclines his seat disintegrating your knees.&nbsp;</p><p>But on the bright side, with a couple of tricks and gadgets, a long flight can be a productivity sanctuary.</p><p>A place where to do the work that thrives on network disconnection. Like writing this article. Focusing on that assignment, clear up your email inbox and writing a few chapters of that book that you never have time to work on.</p><p>It’s all about isolating yourself from distractions.&nbsp;</p><p>And to do so I would like to share with you the list of my must-have travel accessories for in-flight enhanced productivity.</p><p> </p><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00M1NEUA0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=B00M1NEUA0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=waou-21"><strong>Bose QuietComfort 25</strong></a></h3><p>Have you ever experienced an 8 hour flight during the night after a 12 hour shift?</p>

<p>The aircraft cabin noise that simply doesn't stop, with kids two rows ahead that won't go to sleep, and occasional announcements that interrupt your sleep sinergically create a wall of stress that can’t be destroyed.</p><p>You need do yourself a favour: Buy a pair of noise-canceling headphones.

Besides protecting you from bacteria and other horrors lurking in the air aboard airplanes it create a healthy microclimate for your nose and mouth. Quick tip: bring always two masks.

the announcement of the Apple Watch.

My biggest concern with wearables is the element of distraction. What 
happens when a device with potential to be incredibly distracting is not 
just in your pocket, but strapped to your wrist? Can devices like Google 
Glass augment our activities without distracting us from the physical 
world?

I'm a fan of "uni-tasking" and I know for sure that the fact that people 
can multi-task without any loss in the quality of their work is simply a 
great myth.

Right now the "wearable" trend is happening simply because it can be done. 

For me gadgets like the Apple Watch, Google Glass need to be artifacts that 
can enhance human abilities. I am fully dependent upon modern technologies, 
because they make me more productive, not less. 

For this reason I wanted to start researching the world of wearable devices 
with something simple. A fitness band.

I spent a good amount of time reading reviews regarding what would be my 
next purchase, and I ended up buying the Jawbone Up24.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about wearable devices, especially after the announcement of the Apple Watch.</p><p>My biggest concern with wearables is the element of distraction.
What happens when a device with potential to be incredibly distracting is not just in your pocket, but strapped to your wrist?

<p>The reason of this purchase was done for the following reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>No distracting screen </li>
<li>Sleep tracking * Smart Alarm </li>
<li>Longer battery life </li>
<li>API that can be used with third party applications and services</li>
</ul>

<p>After a week of using the device I'm still cognizant that I'm wearing it, this causing me to slightly change my usual behavior. For instance I try to go to sleep earlier, or eat healthier. But checking the app only twice a day reveals that, given my concerns on distraction, I made a great purchase.</p>

<p>However I felt that more could be done with this device.</p>

<h2 id="jawboneup24andtheinternetofthings">Jawbone Up24 and The Internet of Things</h2>

<p>Besides tracking my sleep and activity the Jawbone Up can also act as a catalyst for all kinds of actions. The API support third-party apps including <a href="https://ifttt.com/jawbone_up">IFTTT</a> <a href="https://ifttt.com/jawbone_up">https://ifttt.com/jawbone_up</a> (If This, Then That), which lets you use the Web to automate responses to certain triggers.</p>

<p>A couple of useful actions that I trigger daily are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn off the lights in my house when I go to bed (<a href="http://www2.meethue.com/it-it/">Philips Hue</a>)</li>
<li>Slowly turn the bedside table light on as an alarm clock with a natural looking light </li>
<li>Turn on the coffee machine when I wake up </li>
<li>When I go to sleep Turn down the House temperature (<a href="https://nest.com">Nest</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preventup24todrainyouriphonebatterylife">Prevent UP24 to drain your iPhone Battery Life</h2>

<p>Even if the <strong>Up24</strong> uses Bluetooth Low Energy radio technology, for some reason, it appears that the app currently suffers from a bug that drains rapidly the iPhone battery. The reasons for this bug resides in the App and the devices communicating every 20 seconds. To avoid this all you need to do is simply "kill" the app by double tapping on the home button and swiping up on the application. Don't worry the device will keep on working perfectly by simply syncing to the app only when it get's opened.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://jawbone.com/store/buy/up24">UP24</a> is packed with handy features to make it one of the best in the business, the integration with third party services makes it even more fun to use and to experiment with, without distracting you.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5/503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea/54a13f95e4b0d1a214b29b94/1428139432901/1500w/" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="617" height="453"><media:title type="plain">Jawbone Up24 Review</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Inbox vs Outlook Mail vs Mailbox: Battle for the best iOS Email Client</title><category>App Reviews</category><category>Productivity Tips</category><dc:creator>Tommaso Nervegna</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 19:21:01 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.tommasonervegna.com/blog/2014/12/10/inbox-vs-accompli-mail-vs-mailbox-battle-for-the-best-ios-email-client</link><guid isPermaLink="false">503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5:503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea:548896ffe4b08776ce108619</guid><description>Let's get things straight.

<p>Let's get things straight. I'm one of those guys who needs to reach inbox zero by the end of the day. I treat my email inbox as a sort of a Task list.

Nothing remains in the Inbox.</p><p>My iPhone is probably my primary tools with which I check my Email, however in the last years Apple’s Mail for iOS has remained largely the same since its first release…clearly this isn't good.</p><p>Treating my Inbox as a Task List, I required a much more powerful tool than the standard Email App, so a long time ago I started looking for the best Email client available for iOS. The quest ended recently with me left with three outstanding email clients: <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/inbox/">Google Inbox</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8">Outlook</a> (was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.acompli.com">Accompli Mail</a>)</strong>.</p><p> </p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailboxapp.com"><strong>Mailbox</strong></a><br />Mailbox is close to my dream app for email management. If you, like me, embrace the GTD method and used to treat your email Inbox as a messy landing port for "maybe" actionable emails, Mailbox will rock your world and will make you a true email Ninja.</p><p>Before Mailbox I used to ensure myself to not leave work unless my Inbox was empty. Many times the reason an email is waiting in our inbox is only because there is an action required in order to process it. To hack this system I moved the task required in the email in my to-do app (Cultured Code Things) and just then decide whether it was due today or another day of the week. The milestone was to get the task out of my inbox.</p><p>Mailbox reduces the time spent in managing your to-do list with just a few swipes and let's you reach the legendary Inbox Zero more than once a day.</p><p>Want to archive an email? Just swipe to the right, removing it from view. Want to delete some spam? Just swipe a bit longer to the right. Put it off until tomorrow. Or this weekend. Or someday, by simply swiping to the left. A longer swipe to the left will allow you to archive your email in a specific list.</p><p>In my case, with the default "Later", "Archive" and the "Inbox" folder I have 5 separated lists by adding a "To reference" and a "to Delegate" folder.</p><p>And voilà! Inbox zero. Daily.<br />The biggest issue with Mailbox is that it lacks of Microsoft Exchange support. Otherwise it would be simply perfect...</p><p> </p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/inbox/"><strong>Inbox by Google</strong></a><br />Google unveiled a few months ago Inbox, a new email client for Gmail that takes a different approach to email. Google frames Inbox as a product that recognizes we now use email in very different ways today, but email (and email clients) have barely changed.</p><blockquote>With this evolution comes new challenges: we get more email now than ever, important information is buried inside messages, and our most important tasks can slip through the cracks—especially when we’re working on our phones. For many of us, dealing with email has become a daily chore that distracts from what we really need to do—rather than helping us get those things done.</blockquote><p>Google Inbox is different in a few ways, with a strong focus on some interesting features:</p><ul><li><strong>Bundles:</strong>&nbsp;Inbox can group together similar emails into bundles such as Travel, Social Networking, Purchases, Promotions.</li><li><strong>Highlights</strong>: Inbox will try to intelligently highlight key information from your emails (event details, flight itineraries) and even pull in information from outside your emails (such as real-time status of a delivery or flight)</li><li><strong>Reminders, Assists, and Snooze</strong>: Inbox also becomes a kind-of to-do app, able to remind you about emails or tasks to accomplish at a later date. This includes letting you snooze on messages until a later date.</li></ul><p>My main issue with Inbox, besides the lack of Microsoft Exchange support is the fact that it tries to do too much, resulting too much cluttered. Also, the default Snoozes do not fit with my usual way of dealing with emails...but's that is simply a personal opinion.</p><p> </p><p><br /><a href="#"><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8">M</a></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8"><strong>icrosoft Outlook</strong></a><br />The biggest difference between Outlook, Mailbox or Inbox is that it has four main sections: "Mail", "Calendar," "Files" and "People," each with its own tab at the bottom of the screen. A very intuitive agenda, similar to what you'll find in iOS is available in one click. The great thing is that you can add dates to any imported calendar without leaving the app.&nbsp;</p><p>The other tabs provide a clean approach to filtering through the content of your emails. For example, I can quickly access a file that I sent recently to forward it without having to dig through the email itself. Great.</p><p>Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;also provides support to Microsoft Exchange, in this way I can easy access my corporate email without having to rely on the default Mail App.</p><p> </p><p><strong>TL:DR - And the Winner is...</strong><br /><a href="#"><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8">M</a></strong></a><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8"><strong>icrosoft Outlook</strong></a>. Acompli’s is my go-to dashboard for almost everything related to productivity. There aren’t a million complex options or contact management settings, but it simply does email, calendar and contacts incredibly well for a singular app without looking chaotic nor cluttered.<br />And by the way, it's free!&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Product Manager and UX Designer — What’s The Difference?</title><category>UI/UX Design</category><dc:creator>Tommaso Nervegna</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 12:20:43 +0000</pubDate><link>“Product https://medium.com/p/d35d7b8023f</link><guid isPermaLink="false">503f90c5c4aa93dffe120ad5:503f90c5c4aa93dffe120aea:5460ad9ce4b0b49a35e436ca</guid><description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
