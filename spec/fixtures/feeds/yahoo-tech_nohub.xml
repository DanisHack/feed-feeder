Unfortunately, all of that work can become a liability if your spine feels like it’s perpetually eroding. That’s where products like HELCY, the Healthy Ergonomic Laptop Case for You, come in. Last year, we reported on the Roost laptop stand, which was designed to eliminate Repetitive Stress Injuries for laptop users constantly hunched over a screen. And, while that was an interesting prospect (and not to mention a crowdfunding success), HELCY claims to take it a step further, saying its the “only laptop bag that improves your posture.” Not only does it help with back pain and RSIs, but it even doubles as both a laptop case  and stand. Related: Apple’s latest patent could let you type without a keyboard Using a pair of leather carrying straps, HELCY appears to bend to an adjustable height, emulating the utility of a laptop stand. Unfortunately, seeing as it’s a case and not a stand, you might expect it to look frivolous during real-world use. But, contrarily, its subtle appearance might even give it an edge on traditional laptop stands. The only notable setback that immediately stands out for HELCY, although this extends to other laptop stands like it, is the requirement of an additional mouse and keyboard other than the ones already built in to your computer. While using it may reduce aches, carrying it and the required peripherals around will be a hassle. Even so, HELCY has apparently received some actual medical recognition, according to its Kickstarter page, which lists an endorsement from Orthopedist and German American Association of Osteopathy member Dr. Heilmann. “Bad posture can lead to Repetitive Strain Injury syndrome, which causes muscle tensions, back pain and [headaches],” Heilmann explains. “HELCY improves your posture, your health and your happiness as well as saves you from chronic pain.” HELCY comes from German founder Amanda Birkenholz as a product of Helcy Productive Designs. Interestingly enough, she herself experienced neck and back pain, presumably from everyday laptop use, resulting in this invention. The Kickstarter, which suggests a June 2016 release frame, is aiming for a funding target of €17,000 (about $19,200 in US dollars)Also watch: Asus ROG GX700 Hands On Please enable Javascript to watch this video</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<article><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/helcy-laptop-case-wants-fix-164851432.html?src=rss"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uCPbWcN4wTK.XzIEoelSJQ--/aD02MDA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w900/1c2af750b114239f079f6d4f4571639e3a50b608.png" width="900" height="auto" style="max-width:600px;"/></a></p><p>If you’re anything like me, you probably spend a million hours a day clicking away at your keyboard and making nonsense appear on your screen.

Seattle-based law firm PCVA is investigating a potential class-action lawsuit over the security feature that could leave some iPhone users with bricked phones,The Guardian reported. (PCVA has not responded to Mashable yet.) See also: Mysterious &apos;Error 53&apos; is bricking iPhones, rendering them useless The basic problem occurs if your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus home button is repaired anywhere other than an Apple Store or Apple-authorized repair center. At first, the phone might work — with everything, including Touch ID, seeming perfectly fine. But then, when you try to update to a newer version of iOS (or you attempt to restore your phone from a backup), the software checks to make sure the Touch ID sensor matches the rest of the hardware. If it doesn&apos;t find a match — and only authorized Apple repair centers can pair a phone and Touch ID sensor — your phone will stop functioning. According to Apple, this is a security measure, since the company pairs the iPhone&apos;s Touch ID sensor with a specific phone and doesn&apos;t allow those sensors to work with other phones. That&apos;s because of the sensitive nature attached to Touch ID, which includes information like your fingerprints and Apple Pay. Last week, an Apple spokesperson toldMashable that Error 53 &quot;is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers.&quot; But there haven&apos;t been many details about Error 53 until now, which poses a problem for users. Even though it&apos;s a valid security measure, plenty of users left with bricked phones are angry that the only official solution is to visit an authorized Apple Store and pay for an out-of-warranty repair — which generally means replacing the phone entirely. Repair center concerns While most cases of Error 53 arise from getting a home button repaired at an unauthorized dealer, some reports state that a screen replacement could also trigger the error message. The only surefire way to avoid an Error 53 bricking: only have your phone repaired at an Apple Store or at an authorized repair shop. That might be fine for users in the United States or in western Europe, but in parts of the world without Apple Stores or easy access to authorized repair centers, that can be problematic. Moreover, official Apple repairs typically cost much more than repairs by third parties. It&apos;s this issue — that Apple may be forcing users to use its own (often more expensive) repair centers — that seems to be at the crux of a potential class-action situation. PCVA states on its website that it believes &quot;Apple may be intentionally forcing users to use their repair services, which cost much more than most third party repair shops. Where you could get your screen replaced by a neighborhood repair facility for $50-80, Apple charges $129 or more. There is incentive for Apple to keep end users from finding alternative methods to fix their products.&quot; That&apos;s a criticism Apple has faced by the greater repair community as well. Kyle Wiens, CEO of the popular website and repair guideiFixit, wrote a blog post about Error 53 last week that laid out some of his issues with it from the point of view of repair shops. I argued last week that a potential alternative to bricking iPhone devices with un-paired home buttons would be to disable Apple Pay and anything else associated with the secure element. Since then, security and iOS experts pointed out that&apos;s not tenable because of how iOS works with official hardware. Without any official word from Apple, it&apos;s hard to know whether this is actually an option, but it does seem as though therecould be some alternative to bricking the phone. And if that isn&apos;t an alternative on current iPhone devices, it&apos;s certainly something Apple should consider in the future. Balancing security versus serviceability Part of the problem with the Error 53 saga is that there&apos;s no clear answer. Fundamentally, it&apos;s agood thing that Apple is taking the proper precautions to pair the secure element and Touch ID with phones so that they cannot be swapped. Can you imagine the outrage if a simple replacement of the home button could trigger a malicious break-in to your iPhone&apos;s secure enclave? Any company asking customers to entrust its biometric and financial data to a phone needs to be taking the proper precautions to make sure that information cannot be hacked. Apple&apos;s network of official stores and authorized repair centers just isn&apos;t not wide enough to service all users in all areas. Yes, Apple does repairs via mail, but that doesn&apos;t always cut it when you&apos;re talking about something as essential as an iPhone. Moreover, because only authorized Apple centers can pair phones and Touch ID sensors, it really does limit how the consumer can get unbreakable phone repairs. That means if a third partydid buy a genuine Apple Touch ID button, it still wouldn&apos;t be possible to repair it without risking the wrath of Error 53. Still, I can&apos;t see Apple backing down on its commitment to device and data security — nor should it. If there is a solution other than just going to an Apple Store, it may have to involve enacting a broader authorized third-party repair program that would let more shops and repair technicians be certified to repair Apple devices.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<article><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-could-face-class-action-211447306.html?src=rss"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rjMluaKN_H4Y435mGbCC8A--/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1500/806c419adcb6667accc0db536de79fe6e634c101.jpg" width="1500" height="auto" style="max-width:600px;"/></a></p><p>At least one U.S. law firm is looking into bringing a class-action lawsuit against Apple over the &quot;Error 53&quot; issue affecting certain iPhone owners.

Apple quickly added the ability to use the Apple Remote app to make entering text easier, but with Siri built in, it always seemed like the voice control should be more robust. Soon, users will be able to do a whole lot more with only their voices, thanks to the inclusion of voice dictation. The feature was introduced in the latest beta version of tvOS, Macrumors reports. Dictation isn’t just useful for searching, but can also be used for entering user names and passwords, which should bring a sigh of relief to anyone who has struggled to enter a long password using the remote.Related: The Apple TV doesn’t have picture-in-picture (yet) but here’s what it could look like Once the software update bringing this new feature goes live later this year, you’ll be asked whether you want to enable dictation. Once you do, the search bar will allow you to hold down the Siri button on the remote and simply say the text you want to enter, with a level meter appearing on the screen to let you know whether the remote is able to hear you clearly. Dictation isn’t the only way to better control your Apple TV with your voice in the coming update. Users will now be able to search the App Store using Siri and commands like “search the App Store for VLC.” These new features are the latest added to the increasingly feature-rich tvOS 9.2, which is now in its third beta. Other features added so far include iCloud Photo Library and Live Photos, Bluetooth keyboard support, an updated app switcher, and the ability to group apps into folders, similar to iOS.Related:  Apple TV’s universal search expands with results from Fox Now, FX Now, and Nat Geo TV While the features are available to beta users now, there is no official word yet on when the update will be released, though it will likely be released this spring alongside updates to Apple’s other platforms. An Apple Watch-focused event is rumored to be planned for March, and assuming it actually takes place, we’ll likely see many of these new Apple TV features shown off then.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<article><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/sick-entering-text-apple-tv-132818369.html?src=rss"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6k2x47oiQqc9A1GiI1pC.Q--/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w1500/45162b604254570bf0ed9531c0e4eb577c523033.jpg" width="1500" height="auto" style="max-width:600px;"/></a></p><p>The fourth-generation Apple TV is generally great, but it does have a few issues, one of which is entering text with the included remote.

In a statement Monday, Instagram confirmed the feature was part of the 7.15 update for both iOS and Android users but said that the feature will begin to appear this week so it could still take a few days before all users see it. Once the feature is live, you can access it from your account settings in your profile. When you&apos;ve added one or more additional accounts, you can switch between them by tapping on your username at the top or your profile. The app will also show the profile photo of the account you&apos;re currently using throughout the app to make it easier to see which account you&apos;re posting from. Until now, lack of official support for the feature — critical for those who oversee multiple accounts — has caused many users to turn to third-party clients in order to post and view feeds from separate accounts simultaneously. Though Instagram has previously tolerated third-party developers on its platform, the company recently announced a change in its developer policy that would restrict nearly all third-party feed-viewing apps.
